realized i was not quite like the other kids  falling for boys and doing the popular thing  i started to become very internalized and depressed  i even tried to kill myself a few times  but i was chicken shit and never did manage to succeed  my parents pressured me to do online classes skip a grade and be smart  i did most  but in grade 12 i was struggling a lot  i finished school with a great gpa  but i never finished my online class  i just had too much on my plate  my mental health was really bad here  anyways i decided to switch my major and take that class while i did the other intro classes at school  i told my parents  they decide i was horrible and i got yet another beating  i tried to keep it up  i was 17 and too scared to take a student loan so i got a night job and started working and school during the day  with my mental health being the way it was and animosity at home i was struggling  my grades at school staryed to drop  i started to get worse and worse  after two semester and realizing i wasnt going to succeeed i decided to quit school  i moved out and spent a month just sleeping  i was so mentally exhausted  i then looked for a job  i found a decent job working in a lab  i started to save as i eventually wanted to return to university  i went back to tutoring  since i was tutoring in highschool some of my networks were still around  so i approached them  back in highschool i used to tutor at my parents home  the students asked if i was able to do that again  i approached my parents hesitant  offered to share part of my earning and tutor there  they said sure 50 50  hey that was more money than i was making now so it would only help me save more  time goes on  our relationship seems better  they tell me they miss me and i should move home  i am foolish because i believe them as i am moving home a year later  enrolling in local college to do a bridge program and get into the program i want  i am lonely and have no friends and my parents are back to yelling and hating me  i look for friends more importantly i am looking for love  highschool people made jokes about me being gay to me  i ignored them  ofcourse they were not wrong  but i was not the in crowd so i could not afford to be gay aswell  so here i am thinking i am on path to sorting my shit out at 19 and i meet this woman at the college  she seems really interested we hit it off  she tell me she loves me and i am puddy  i do everything she wants  things at my home are tense so i find any and every excuse to stay out and with her  one day she needs financial help and i being an idiot let her have my savings with a promise she will return them within a semester and then she changes  she starts seeing exes and new people  she calls me names  she makes me feel gross about myself and i gain a bunch of weight  my doctor says my health is no good  i am hardly sleeping  i am prescribed xanax  i hate it so i just let myself cry for days and not leave my room  i

shortness of breath and felt uneasy throughout the day  i have done most of my coping techniques to calm down    cleaned my room and the kitchen a little bit  went outside for some sun and fresh air  trimmed my beard that i have been thinking about doing for days  and whatnot    to no avail  i try to counteract it by writing positive things on my journal  it did not do much  though  towards bedtime  i felt a little better  relaxed  at that point  i just wished that it will not continue through the next day   for several days now  and even weeks  i think i have done good  i have been asking myself  healthy or not healthy   so i can calibrate my actions towards healthy throughout the day  it is quite effective  but not wholly  there is a time that i thought it would be healthy to go outside and have some sun  i did  but i also smoked a cigarette  and i might have a walk to the store to get some more later  i know  it is bad  but i am kind of riding along with it  i feel like it is better to go out and walk to get some cigarettes than to stay indoors for the rest of the day and sulk  at this point  i just try to get out of the house more often  and sometimes i compromise to do just that  i just think that thatis healthier   the thing though  i feel that at some point  i would not know if i am becoming truly healthy or not  maybe  at one point  my  healthy  is actually unhealthy and i would not be able to tell  i think i am ready to get professional help again  it is been a full year ever since i last spoke to a professional  i suddenly stopped going because i felt that it was not going anywhere  and i felt dismissed by my therapist  the latter may be subjective  maybe i just cannot move on from my ex  like she said  and not about coming back to the place where i was once i felt like myself  i asked her once if coming back to my homecountry was a good idea  i thought that was the last time and place that i felt like myself without all the heavy depression relatively   that may be it will make sense to go back  yes my ex was there  but so was my friends  school  at that time   and me  she replied   you just miss your ex   i could not said no because yes  i did  then she continued on with god knows what because at that moment  i remember closing shut  ever since  i have not opened up to anyone and have been enduring this shit on my own   and god be damned  my last year was my most difficult  everyday  when i woke up  i am greeted by a slur of self depreciation  i do not even get it  how is that my first thought of the day  how did it surpass  i am thirsty  or  i need to pee   i have suppressed most of my thoughts of previous happiness  mostly with the aforementioned past life  i thought   those are not yours anymore and it is heinous to even think about it   consequently  i have lost all my contacts from that time  i d like to celebrate me after i moved  but i just cannot see anything to celebrate  i have kept a journal almost throughout the year  i wish i can say that i have progressed  but no  up until a couple of weeks ago  i was the same  i stagnated for almost a year  not counting the past years  that i have done so as well   i find little to distract me from my misery  i tried to play games  do some chores  watch movies  etc  but the thought would just catch up   nothing you do matters  all of it is only a farce   i tried hard not to compare myself to others  progress  but whenever i do with my own  thereis nothing  everyday it is a little better  sometimes worse  i coasted  i convinced myself that that was me  i really do deserve hell for all what i have done  and to justify them  i will need to kill myself   it was difficult to think otherwise because for the one good thing that i have guilt riddenly thought that i have or done  i have ten bad things to convince me that i deserve to stay in hell  it is still difficult to this moment  now  i hope that thereis a way for it not to be  or at the very least a little easier to be alive  i am 28 now  a college dropout  no work experience  no savings  no friends  none anything  it is difficult to imagine that i will be someone someday from this point of view  but i have hope  finally  i can see myself past my depression   i wish i could say that this is the end  but it is merely the beginning  and the most difficult  i have been contemplating for days now to ask help from my family  but i am frightened with what they will say  the last time i confided with my parents  they make it all about themselves  they told me that i had a difficult time is because i was far away from them  it may have contributed to the problem  but i can definitively say that they are not what makes me  i knew that i was having trouble  i have my internal contradictions  but it was not them  they just turned me off  but all i have now is them  i do not have anymore friends to confide with  their lives are so far away from when we last interacted that i do not think they want to go back to a time when i was in their lives  i do not want to burden them anymore  god knows i have done enough to bring misery to their lives  and i will hate myself if i added some more   i have no other moves left  i have hope now  but i feel stuck on this part  i need some encouragement and humility to push through this next step  to get help  i thought maybe i can find it here  i did not know where else to go  please  i know i can do it  but i feel frightened and feel unable to    i apologize for being selfish and needy ',\n",

start 2020 feeling better and i hope some else can relate      1st jan 2020     i hate writing these kinds of things but im giving it a go anyway to see if i feel any different after    ive never been more depressed in my life  last year it feels like i had more depressed days than normal days  i do not want to feel like this anymore  i want this to be a better year but i do not know how i can achieve that at this point  i have contemplated suicide  almost regularly  and even running away either which wont resolve my problems  only i can  and that feels like an incredibly daunting task  i cannot do this alone  therapists are expensive      i smoke weed on a nightly basis to get away from this temporarily  but in the end it still makes me feel even more depressed  especially the following day  it feels like these depressive thoughts are trapped inside with me  i should stop and take a break from smoking  but at the same time i enjoy smoking and the feeling you get while high  im in some pretty substantial cognitive dissonance over this  i know this is not a great option to tackle it  but it certainly beats getting addicted to alcohol to escape my problems  i do exercise fairly regularly as well      the following three are what i want most in life  and these things i think will give me that happiness i long for  now i know  some aspects of this are unrealistic and likely wont happen anytime soon but its these things that are always on my mind  i want to achieve them one way or another      girlfriend    i have been single my whole life  never had an irl girlfriend and these days ive never felt lonelier than ever  i just want someone to come home to that loves me  to get a hug and be told everything will be ok  i just want someone i can be happy with  make new memories  and just start life afresh with basically  i just do not want to feel alone any longer  i want to experience actual love and affection for the first time  and to reciprocate that  i crave this more than anything in life      am so introverted  i have few irl friends which most are guys  i have only ever had guy friends  i can talk to girls  i think  but i never know how to initiate anything other than small talk  they just never seem to be interested  and i do not know why  in my friend groups  and in my work team i am the only single person and i feel left out whenever talks about sois come up      i feel like i am a bit of a social guy  i do go out for nights out occasionally and go to gigs regularly  and mosf of the time if i get invited to someones birthday party or a night out i will usually go  i do meet new people during these occasions and again when it comes to talking to girls it seems like that goes nowhere either   even if its just friends    i do not know what i am doing wrong      my family are stupidly religious with a very very old school mentality  they genuinely believe and live their life by their religion in very old school traditional ways  they want me to get an arranged marriage and have hinted this over the last couple of years  now this is a quick fix for this whole girlfriend problem  but fuck that  i could never ever marry someone like them  especially if i do not know them  it will never work and it does not  not at this side of the planet  my sister and my second oldest brother got married this away and they are not happy with their lives and marriage  they are miserable because my brother and sister are just simply incompatible with their sois  i remember them barely having much time to get to know each other  and the fact that both have kids makes life even more difficult for them  i do not want this       the only person who is truly happy in this family is my oldest brother who lives in another country with his wife he knew and dated for years before getting married 13 years ago and are still very happy together  i wish i could have this  she is from a different culture altogether and her family practice a different religion  my dad hated this and it took him years before he allowed his wife to come into our house      i remember when i turned 16 my dad sat me down on my birthday and told me that i can never have a girlfriend  i still think about this and it bothers me  i really want to prove him wrong   i wish one day i can bring a girl home and explain that i do not want the life he wants me to have  i want to show him that i want to be with that person and not with someone who he decides for an arranged marriage  this will be a very difficult day when it comes but is necessary  he needs a reality check        my own apartment    i still live at home with my dad  step mother  older brother  his wife and their two kids  it is too much sometimes  i cannot go and pursue the things i want in life whilst stuck here      i have been wanting to move out all year but thatis not an easy task either  either i save for many years to put down a deposit and then get a mortgage which is the best method  but i do not know how long this will take and im already desperate to get out of this house  the other option would be to rent  which is something i can do in the next few months but will have no support from my family if i do this  i d rather do this as it means i can get away now of course and i have seen some really nice furnished flats going for great prices that im certain i can afford  i am in two minds  every time i mention this to my dad he makes it sound like a terrible thing to do and ultimately makes me feel worse for these ideas  he wants me to get an arranged marriage first before moving out  fuck that  my brothers have my support here which is good      band    music is what i live for  i love music  i love listening  watching  playing and generally being around music  i genuinely think if i did not have this there would be no point for me being alive  my whole life over the last 10 years has evolved around it       i have always wanted to play in a band  i have in the past and im desperate to get back into the scene again  i just want to be around similar minded people that i can jam with and ultimately be on stage having a great time playing good music with  the feeling of being on stage infront of an audience who are also having a great time is on another level  a lot of the time when listening to music or watching a band live i imagine myself being in their position      this is another thing i think i will always pursue so i am not giving up hope in this sense  i need to get the apartment situation sorted first before i can join a band      again  my family have a problem with this  they think it is a waste of time and believe i should spend that time on religion instead  like them  i had to quit my last band right before we had gigs lined up and had studio time booked so we can record out first album simply because of my family  my dad demanded i stop and sell all of my guitars and equipment  that day was the worst day of my life  to have something i so dearly love just taken away like that  and i have still not recovered from it  this was in aug 2016 and im certain this kicked off the depression      they think its embarrassing me going out to band practices and gigs carrying my equipment  they think it makes them look bad to their friends and family who are also just as crazy  delusional religious like them because their kids do not do these kinds of things  it is this mentality that also affects the whole girlfriend thing      i still play regularly on my own and still buy and sell instruments  i always have to figure out how to sneak them in and out the house which is always very stressful otherwise they kick up a massive fuss if they catch me  and i always walk away very annoyed and back depressed  one time i saved up for a guitar i really wanted for a long time  it was not cheap and when i took it home i put it in the garage to hide before picking it later that night when everyone was asleep  when i went back its was simply gone  you cannot lose a guitar inside a hardcase easily  the garage was locked as well  when i confronted my parents they did not own up and never did  i know 100  they did it  my dad denied it and step mother denied it even more  i still have never seen that guitar since  this still bothers and scares me  it is not the first time they have done something like this      they have never given me a proper reason why they are so against music  i one time got an answer out my dad but it was bullshit  he did not want me getting addicted to drugs and getting into music even more so i can continue doing drugs  wtf                                                                                     after writing this it is now more clear that there is a root source of this and that is my family and their bullshit backwards and religious ways  i know moving out is the best way to get away so that i can then finally have those things i want without them holding me back and telling me no  it is a long and difficult journey and ive never wanted anything more in my life  ive never made a new years resolution and this will be my first for 2020 and to apply for the rest of the decade  i will get there one way or another ',\n",

going to school full time and have a pretty solid gpa  my plan is to become a highschool teacher and i am making decent progress towards it  this is about the only thing that i can tell myself for reassurance when i really start to feel down though  still  it will take me 4 years  1 1 2 more  of community college to get the associates and the 90 units i need for subbing and an additional 3 years to become a teacher  and i feel like that makes me seem weak  especially since you are supposed to get that associates degree in 2 years      now to explain the insecurities i have  i guess ill start with my weight  i think being a fat kid really messes with your development  not just because kids constantly tease you but it literally caused my hormones to go out of whack and give me high estrogen in highschool  i lost 100 pounds before my senior year and i am still chubby 3 years down the road    i just cant stick to a exercise and diet regimen for very long  i am about 30 pounds overweight with probably 20 of those pounds being fat  i do go running up hills and or do bodyweight circuits and burn around 600 additional calories a day  still i offset this by eating 2800 calories or more every day  with all thatis going on in my life i wish i could just accept my current weight and say i am healthy  but i am not that attractive because of it  i have a lot of weight on my stomach and i have a bit of female breast tissue that makes me look feminine with my shirt off  my body makes me cringe when i look at it and i constantly am thinking about how gross i probably look  with all the other shit going on in my life i just cant set aside more than the 2 hours a day i already put into my body and the food addiction has actually improved from when i was a kid and would eat 4000 calories a day  i am hungry 24 7 and it hurts when people tell me i just need to stop being lazy and get into shape upon bringing this up      as far as my face goes  i am like an average 7 10 or so  i cannot really complain about it even though i could look a lot nicer  i am told i look like a 16 year old a lot     another huge insecurity of mine is having a small penis  it is right under 5 inches with girth on the low end of average and i worry it will severely limit the girls that will be willing to have a relationship with me  i know everyone is different  i just hope that the girls i am attracted to dont end up being the type to care so much      the combination of extra weight  female breast tissue  a bit of a baby face  and being 6 0 tall make me feel like an awkward teenager still and my body just wont grow out of it      as far as hobbies go i play guitar regularly and i do slowly achieve goals i set for it  still  i dont have the time to put into it to become a professional level musician even though my theory knowledge is close to it  i used to be really good at piano but i stopped playing when my mom died  music in general is the only reason i am still alive as corny as that sounds  it is my favorite part of the human experience and one of the closest things we have to magic  although guitar can do a good job distracting me  i dont feel fulfilled when practicing in my room      in highschool i was a heavy drug user for about 10 months of my life  i cannot say for sure  but i theorize that i did a lot of damage to my mental development by taking xanax  opiates  and muscle relaxers damn near every day and often at the same time  washing them down with alcohol or codeine cough syrup  i was so depressed back then and my parents being old fashioned  did not believe in depression  i self medicated and self destructed for a while until something interesting happened  i asked the girl of my dreams out and she rejected me  my initial urge was to commit suicide but somehow rationality stepped in and i just threw away the drugs and set out to improve myself  i lost 70 pounds in 4 months and came back to my senior year completely different and clean except for marijuana  i think i wanted to prove her wrong about me because in my mind i was pretty sure she just thought i was a loser      eventually i ended up experimenting with psychedelics which sadly gave me ptsd for about a year  i was believing in spiritual forces and extra sensory perceptive abilities because i was having flashbacks from the massive doses of lsd i had done  it took me a long time to figure out that it was my amygdala giving me flashbacks and that i wasnt seeing into some higher dimension and it really fucked me up to be borderline psychotic for all that time      at this point i have never been even slightly romantically involved with a girl even though many have been interested in me  i have strong requirements that any girl i date be a potential candidate for marriage even if she isnt necessarily the girl i end up marrying  why would i date someone who i know my relationship wont work out with  one girl initially seemed great  but as we talked more  i realized her values were different from mine and thatis the closest i have been to being in a relationship  most girls  it only takes a few weeks of knowing them to rule them out  i find my situation to be additionally complicated by the fact that i like conservative minded women  but i am not christian and not exactly conservative  i have bounced back and forth on the political spectrum until deciding the best result would be of compromise and unity  meeting in the middle  a decrease of radical ideas rather than a swing in either direction seems to be a philosophy that can be applied at multiple levels of life    a lot of college girls are crazy liberal and having tons of sex with different guys  not planning for the future  going to festivals etc    i would not set myself up for failure with these types who are the opposite of the christian girls      i want to meet someone who is a good compliment to me  that would build me up and be a positive force in my life   but who also isnt trapped by dogma and institutional fears  i think i am a very exceptional person  which does not mean i am great but that i fall under many exceptions both very good and very bad  this seems to make it harder to find people who i really connect with on a deep level even though superficially connecting with people is something i am quite adept at  especially for an introvert      i write all of this out of loneliness and fear  i want to have someone to show affection to and to recieve affection from  and i am worried that my inadequacies and my past and my odd perspective will ultimately lead me to becoming a failure who no one good wants to be around      i know i might be building a slippery slope here but this feeling gnaws at me constantly  along with occasional paranoia and panic  and sometimes i just go completely numb  you see  i have really bad depression but i try not to let it define me and i dont like thinking that every word that comes out of my mouth is the result of a mental illness  so i have laid on the table so much of what bothers me on a daily basis and then decided to reveal that yes  i am depressed and i am also a human being who wants to feel like they are more than a diagnosis ',\n",

              " 'how to deal better with depression and sources of meaning i found        a string of thoughts i wrote for myself after 8 years of existential depression     meaning can be obtained through pleasure    through a sense of legacy of leaving something behind     through attaching your identity to things that will outlive you     through accepting social responsibility  social roles    through believing in a religion because all of them promise a survival of our consciousness in some form or other    from waiting for technological immortality which wont be afforfable because of overcrowding considerations    if there isnt one   make one  because psychologically you need it  you need to feel like a person with worth in a world with meaning or else your brain will short circuit and inhibit your behaviour so as to not waste energy  it could be anything that makes workthile the suffering life brings     speaking of worth   self esteemis biggest component is social conparison usually this manifests unconsciously in behaviour  your happiness will always be relative to others   achievements and lives if left unscrutonized     life can be seen in the positive light like this  as the only chance to do what you want  the only chance to vibe with a friend to see a sunset to get high   to make love or just to exist to drink a cold glass of water on a hot day  you are the result of an unbroken link of life  billions of years old  a result of a rare set of circumstances  with an even rarer  goldy locke  like set of conditions  that could be extended as far as the laws of physics  that allow this universe to exist becoming alive is rare     you live in the best time  historically  no king has ever had the luxury you have the life expectancy life quality this spectrum of experiences and  sensations the most peacefull period in history  music other cool people shaped by theese nice times all the human knowledge at your fingertips psychedelics etc     life is linear from 0 to 0   whatever you do  in the end doesnt matter but  since you shouldnt  kill yourself  since you die anyway  you do what you can and the rest doesnt matter       if you learn to embrace stoicism and underestand that happiness shouldnt be the main goal of your existance because its unrealistic you are just thrown in a context when youre born you are influenced by powers far more reaching than you  because this is not your world people joust for position just to get bread on the table of course not every whim will get fullfilled     if you learn to want  but to be free of the outcome or to not want some things at all you will become happy if you have realistic expectations  extracted of wishful thinking this is especially hard for cerebral people who are terrorized by the limits reality and how the world could be  if people were different  first off my advice is to accept the world fully then try to change the world by being a good parent child friend etc     there is nothing youre going to be doing  thats going to radically change how reality or existence works  aside from your own perceptions  use out of sight out of mind or optimistic illusions if you have to dont waste your life ruminating on shit that only makes you feel bad  even if youre correct its not a pragmatic worldview     emotions are low resolution solutions to problems that cant be computed     study neuroplasticity learn about how the dopaminergic system works  that you only feel happiness if you have a purpose and are closing in   to that purpose that evolutionarily youre built so the pleasure of advancing toward the goal is more intense than the pleasure of really achieveing it  in order so you keep striving  it is advantageous to keep busy  in a world where everything keeps evolving  you must run as fast as you can   to remain in the same place     learn about the psychological article  bad is stronger than good  and how were evolutionarily built to percieve better longer and more intense the negative stimuli coupled with the realism achieved when being pessimistic arguably the most calibrated to reality worldview possible      learn to not be driven crazy by things not going well  especially after years of effort ceaseris death a flood or a fire are the best examples  every action is like a coin toss  at each throw the chance is 50  it doesnt matter that it came tails for 9 million times in a row  it doesnt matter that  through effort and strategy and discipline and whatever you did  it came tails for years  at some point itll be different destroying everything you built  realise that it was the wrong exprctation all along thinking that things will have to work out solely because of your wish and track record     this is what we do we consume order and we rearange the previous order  to surive and occupy our time after thats achieved through constant effort and managing conplexity as we can     one of our species superpowers  is to adapt if youve studied psychology or evolutionary theory this is an axiom as such  the hedonic baseline  happines  is one of the most important informations   we revert back to the mean no matter what happens  if we win the lottery or almost get killed it will always go back to the mean the more time you have spent feeling bad the more youve skewed the baseline  cat videos have their purpose as well  not just philosophy dont feel guilty and take all the worlds pain from all cultures and all historical periods on your shoulders       death is both a release to my pain and an end to my joy     life is just a matter of perception and if you havent tried lsd psylocibin or dmt you will never underestand the power of this statement and youre probably an unknowing victim of depressive neuroplasticty you will underestand that even if limited you can choose to focus on the positive side to be pragmatic and encourage the thoughts  that will get you to extract as much out of this  journey chance as possible and not just linger in the abyss forever with your very correct and missunderestood worldview     suicide should be an option when life is unlivable  and be consoled you have that option as long as you live with probably no repercussions except complete cessation of everything that being said human resilience cant be underestimated and the storm of emotions  of some life episodes  shouldnt necesarilly be generalised  ',\n",
              " 'can i leave some baggage here   im not sure if this is the place to post this but here we go  apologies in advance this is going to be all over the place  im on mobile and im lost  not real names  this is a throw away etc etc etc   okay so im 22 m i guess i have been dealing with depression for about 8 years  i have anxiety   i am self conscious and i like to believe im more fucked up than i actually am and if it is okay here i d like to get it off my chest and talk about my life and where i am now to no one in particular   i was never the popular kid  i was known but never popular  i was the kid that got picked last for sports or games  never got to play soccer with the other kids because i wasnt good enough  wasnt included in tag or hide and go seek  but i pressed on not knowing what the other kids were bullying me  i got to play lego or slap jack  tic tac toe  you name it  i played by myself  i had about 3 or 4 friends for most of primary school  kindergarten grade 3   not knowing how to interact with the other kids i was lonely  i didnt realize i was lonely as it was well normal for me  the world was out to get me and i let it  i had no voice  i didnt know how to stand up to myself for fear of hurting the other person for telling them how i felt  i was never taught how to show emotions or how to use them  interpret them  i know what they look like and how they feel but showing them  using them  you would have better luck getting a volcano to spew water  but this is how i was brought up and its what i knew  life for me was like looking through beer goggles for everyone else it was distorted and i had a fake image of what it was  because of this i matured faster in other aspects of life  i grasped adult concepts earlier than most and grew into them  into worrying about what others think of me  always comparing myself to everyone else  not just the best or the people above me but everyone  i felt like everyone hated me and thought i was some annoying kid so i shut myself off from the world  thatis the first few years of life  i ran around as a  happy  lonely kid  as i grew up and was about 10 or 11 i learned to read people and guess what they were feeling thinking  how their day was going n shit  i learned to feed off of everyone is emotions around me rather than feeling my own  i essentially shut off my own emotions without realizing it and now i am struggling with fixing it  i fed off of the kids that were happy and replicated their happiness as my own  i imitated them and copied them to feel included  i grew up like this trying to fill that big empty lonely hole i felt  i buried it deep down and  as a green swamp friend of mine once said  i became an onion  i made layers to try to hide it but nothing seemed to work   sorry this post has kinda became a pity party it was not my intention  fuck it let us continue  the next couple years of my life pretty much continued on like this  building my wall of fake emotions to  protect  everyone else from my greatest enemy    myself  i didnt trust myself to not fuck up  didnt trust myself to really connect with anyone  i lied to everyone around me and pushed anyone away that tried to get close or learn who really was on the inside  it was repulsive and wrong but i didnt know that  i would say this is when i got my first taste of depression around the age of 12  grades 5 7 i was the class runt guinne pig doormat  i was the kid being bullied  the other kids unanimously decided i was the kid they picked on  fucking private religious bullshit school did nothing to prevent what they were doing to me nor did they seem to care hell even the teachers  would pick on me  so i accepted  who i was  and that was the school fuck up  i tried to take their name tag and wear it with pride  yea it worked for a bit as armor  i made myself insensitive to the bullying for the first little bit  but grade 6 is when the smack down really started to happen and i became    the germ  these kids had gotten the idea to give me the permanent cheese touch or the germ as they liked to call it  this was the tipping point for me  all my so called classmates and friends i had suddenly turned on me and i was alone  truly alone  left half dead for the vultures to pick at  i broke  i broke into so many little pieces  all those people i grew up around people i trusted turned  i could not touch anyone with out them screaming  dont touch me germ   great thanks now i have to wash myself  and other hurtful shit like that  they could not even sit in a chair i had used without washing it and sanitizing it  okay i say i was alone but i had 2 friends  payton and dane  they tried to help they tried everything they could but the other kids would not back down  half way thru the school year i attempted suicide  i had the steak knife pointed at my heart and started pushing  i drew a little blood but it hurt to much so i stuck around  i had only told dane and he kept it quite for a while like i asked him to but one day he told me that he had to tell the teacher  it wasnt something he liked knowing and didnt like how close i was to not being here  so he told that i wasnt feeling good in my head  that i was going thru some tough times due to the class and what they were doing  this teacher had 0 clue that it was happening and immediately went to the principal  brought me with her and told me to tell her what was going on  i played dumb for so long hoping that it would just end  i didnt want to deal with it but they persisted and eventually brought dane in and asked him what was up  after he started to say something i broke  i told them almost everything  about me wanting to die  not wanting to live and how i wished everyone else would die first  i didnt tell them how i had attempted suicide  my worst fears had come true  i spoke up and now everyone hated me  they could not bully me but did they hate me  after the whole class got a ripped a new ass hole for pushing a kid to suicidal thoughts  yes i told them i had thoughts  no i didnt tell them i tried  i came back into the class room and i am greeted with silence and stone cold eyes staring back at me  the first thing this kid told me  who i thought was one of the people that i had as an acquaintance   you know op fuck you  you go and cry to the principal that we dont treat you nicely well guess what  you want us to treat you with dignity and respect well how about trying to treat us that way  next time think before you speak   i cannot tell you how much this affected me  that kid got sent home for the rest of the week  this is supposed to be where that part of the story ends right  no those fuckers came back the next and kept calling me the germ  kept bullying me and bullied me harder than before  grade 7 was a repeat of grade 6  aging more and more i hid more and more of my emotions and just kept feeding off others and relying on them for how to react in different situations  elementary school behind me and moving to middle school i made new friends  a new chapter in life  friendsthat didnt judge  one guy even had the same name as me  mysteriouslyreddited   i started to notice girls at this point too  two girls in particular  quinn and anna  quinn is a couple years younger than i had been babysat by my mother and i by her mother  they switched out as they both worked  and she  well quinnis amazing  pretty no beautiful  shes got these eyes that just  her hair    wow  and her smile        just everything  she was my first crush although quickly forgotten  we went to different schools  you know out of sight out of mind  k not like that but i had not seen her in a while   anna on the other had  well i can describe her similarly  but things were different with anna  they were  easier    its  well she was the girl i fell head over heels for and she knew it  we talked for hours upon hours but it was never meant to be  i continued on the same way i did in elementary school  by wearing armor and growing my onion  anna and i stayed close for a couple years me being wrapped around her finger while she went after other guys  i got her a couple boyfriends reluctantly  i introduced her to a couple guys i knew she was crushing on and i enjoyed watching her be with them  as i look back i was feeding off of her boyfriends emotions and mixed them with my own  bad idea 0 10 would recommend   and well this went as well as you may guess  it went great  wrong  i was confused and shut off  shut down and shot down  i do not remember what started a fight between us but it went on for months  it became personal for the both of us  i told her not to come to my funeral she told me to fuck off and go die  words were said damage was done and i thought i was okay with it  i learned quickly that i in fact was not okay and my fight with her had broken my armour and i was bare  everything was out and we both fell into depression because of what we did to each other  i was having more and more suicidal thoughts  i had spiraled to my lowest point that i have ever been  self harm  alchohol  skipping school  it was the worst part of my life  highschool is the hardest for everyone isnt it   its not oof my bad  i was skipping school  fighting with my mothers husband  smoking pot and drinking waaaaay to much booze  the fall out of not having anna in my life was ruining me  yes i felt for her and yes i wanted her back in my life but the hatred for her at the same time was almost outweighing the good i felt for her  i cut everyday for over 2 years  i didnt know what to do  the pain felt good and brought me out of my head and prevented me about thinking about anything as long as the blade was on me  my entire depressive episode was brought on because i could not stand up for myself or tell myself it is okay or when to stop  i lost myself  lost my armor  lost everything  or at least i thought i lost everything when in reality i was only just discovering life  i became cold and truly shut off my emotions and didnt even feed off others  i became a robot  i woke up late went to school skipped all my classes  went home played cod or skyrim and went to bed  rinse repeat and thatis how i lived from day to day  month to month  for a couple years  i still have not reconnected with anna  anna if you end up reading this im sorry for the bad memories  i like to think that we still have some love left for each other but i know thatis false   as i lived like this my family life started to become stretched and strained  being brought up as a christian i was told to believe in god  that hes the answer to all and just ask him for help  i called bullshit and that if he truly cared that none of us would suffer  if we suffer then why the fuck did jesus die on the cross for us  my grandparents and mother didnt take kindly to these words and how dare i speak about god in that manor  after mass one sunday i would have been like 15 we were at the grandparents and the topic of vacations came up and how i had not been on one in years and i d like to go when peeps went down to visit cousins from another town a days drive away  it was spring break and they were leaving next weekend  i inquired if i could go with them and because of my grades i was told no  i told them if they let me go i d pick up the pace in school and i would try  but only if they let me go  well my attitude needed to be fixed because the next thing i know my mother is yelling at me and telling me how entitled i am and that id be lucky to consider even going  me being the teen i was i yelled back  fuck yous were exchanged  my grandfather had enough and tried to manhandle me  no fucking chance gramps not in my current state  we had a fist fight that ended up with him having broken glasses  he litterally ripped my shirt off me  ripped my necklace off and threw me into a door and him thrown onto the floor  he got up and started to yell  get the fuck out of here  you can come back when your damn well ready to apologize until then get out       i replied with  well then i guess it wasnt nice knowing you  when you are ready to get your grandson back track me down and tell me how sorry you are  and left without looking back  he did track me down the next day and told me he was sorry about how he reacted and stepping so far out of line  that night after we made up and got a blizzard i went home to find my motheris husband fuming because of how i talked to my mother which cause a fight with him  that was the night i lost my home  my family  he had disowned me and cast me out like garbage  even tho that was one of my lowest points i didnt see it as a loss  yea i was fucked but i was also free to do what i want when i want  so i started working on myself  i moved to a new city enrolled in a new school and started fresh  while i did climb out of my depressing hole i have yet to beat depression  i got a great girlfriend and living large now adays   started some anti depressants  counseling and what not  well now im going to skip ahead to why i wanted to get some baggage off my back  a few weeks ago i went out to the bar with some friends and i ran into none other than quinn  i d had some pregame drinks  had some drinks while i was there  i didnt eat anything that day  was already dehydrated and alcohol should not be consumed like that while on meds  so i was already drunk  feeling great  i d seen quinn once and didnt know what to say so i just smiled and  ignored  her  well let me tell you it was so fucking hard to ignore her  i mean if you were me you would find it impossible to  so i did what any drunk man does  i had a shot and approached her  asked if i could buy her a drink and  from what i remember we hit it off  i had a blast but tbh i was not looking for anything in her i just remembe how i used to feel but more importantly j remembered all the fun times we use to have growing up and all the memories with her over the years  i was   no i am lonely and she seemed to just kinda be there  so we were talking  and i looked at her and time just seemed to stop  we talked but i do not remember what it was about  at one point i asked if i could kiss her  my self conscience was screaming at me telling me this was not okay but the alchohol was in too deep  there is so much that i wish i could remember about that night but i cant  i dont know what happened what i said or did  this is the hardest i have had to fight this depression in a long time and this time i am worried that i will not be able to win  i do not recognize who i am anymore  i dont like this person i have become  i love my gf but i feel like i am going to drag her down and make her depressed like me  i feel like i am not good enough for her and i am hurting her by being with her  i cant stop thinking about quinn but i think i fucked up even trying to be friends with her  there was a small spark there but nothing major besides i dont want there to be a spark right now  i have talked to my gf and she knows i have feelings for another  it was hard to deal with at first but after we talked about it she knows that im struggling with my feelings and that i am not looking for a way to leave her  i have been on the verge of relapsing and going back to self harm  im not crossing that line because when i do thereis no turning back  im tired of being depressed and i want out but he hardest part is figuring out who i am and if i can keep all my current bridges or if i have to go out and build new bridges  im going to keep trudging on and finding my way thru this fucked up place we call earth  again im sorry this was so long and all over the place  if you read it thanks for listening  if you skip over this story thanks for not wasting your time  that came out wrong but ov well   i am not looking for help i just need to talk to someone',\n",

college  and i chose the liberal arts college because of its better rankings  better reputation  i think   and because i thought i would want to attend a liberal arts college  in hindsight  while i do like the smaller classes and personable relationships with professors  who really care that all their students succeed  i am not so sure if i care so much about the liberal arts education as compared to a larger university  my family heavily pressured me to go to a liberal arts school because they thought it would be the best for me  and because i am undecided and undeclared  and when it came to decisions  they heavily pushed me towards choosing the liberal arts college  so i did  though i had also done my own research and consideration too to be fair  i forewent living with my best friends at the city university for the completely new liberal arts college  which at least on paper seemed to be good because you always hear that college is supposed to be that time of personal growth and you discover yourself and who you are and what you like   i have struggled with social anxiety pretty much all my life  and while i have not been medically diagnosed with depression  though i have not really sought out a diagnosis either   i do have a lot of seemingly depressive episodes  thoughts  and the traits common and seen among depressed people  so i am really sorry if i come across presumptuous here  i know lots of people actually struggle with depression and have been diagnosed   a lot of people look forward to college but i was the opposite  completely nervous and anxious  i wanted to go with my best friends because  well  they were my best friends and i thought that could help make the transition for me to college a lot easier  i still want ed  to personally grow and develop  make new friends  meet new people  discover myself  and all that crap  but i believed as someone with social anxiety that would help make me more confident in my place  though i also feared complacency     towards the latter half of my high school career  i was blessed to finally find a  friend group   having been pretty much lonely all my life with maybe one or two friends at a time  but even among that friend group  i only really had  like  two really close friends   everyone else is a friend  but more so the kind i just hang out with  you know  it happened that those two close friends of mine  as well as another friend of ours  were going to dorm together at the city university and i was really tempted to do that too  live with them  but my family told me  and i told myself  that would be wrong  i was just being motivated by my short term desires and would just be following my friends  but on the other hand  i thought it could benefit me in the long term too because it could make me more socially confident  after finding my friend group in high school i definitely became more confident  not 100   but comparably more open and comfortable than before  but now i have completely regressed again   plus i did not really think i was  following my friends  in the sense you usually hear  like a boyfriend foregoing a really great education for a field he was passionate in just to go to a school with his girlfriend that had his desired program but it was not as good apparently  because i honestly had  and still do not  no idea what i want ed  to major in or do with my life as a career  but i was worried about foregoing the opportunity to attend that better ranked liberal arts college  and ultimately i chose it  not out of happiness or excitement but because i thought maybe it would be best for me  and i feared losing that opportunity to attend   fast forward and i am completely depressed here  i have no friends and am completely lonely  i put in effort to make friends at first and i failed  and i have no energy to do so anymore  and i am even starting to lose the desire and motivation to  although i do not want to be lonely either   partly due to being burnt out from the extremely rigorous academics at this school  it has a reputation for being so   but also due to what i perceive to be my depressive state  i am considering transferring back but i do not know if i should really  i am scared to miss out on potential opportunities for networking or growth that i could have in the future if i stayed here but if i left  and also because i d be transferring down  lower ranked school  less prestigious  not as strong as a reputation i think   but a little part of me says that i just need to find a way to persevere and push through  and transferring would be weak and be giving up  or otherwise a mistake in some aspect  be it personal growth or future career aspects  i do not know what to do  but either way if i stay i find myself constantly regretting not going to that city school and dorming with really my only close friends  and while i could if i transferred  i do not know if i should or if that would be wise  and i am worried if i do transfer i will regret that or it will harm me in the long run or it will be some mistake or something  i have thought about therapy but i just cannot bring myself to muster up the energy to go see a counselor  and when i do have the energy then i just feel like i am exaggerating all this or they will not help and it will just make me more anxious  bc it is a school counselor  so they want me to stay  but also bc therapy has not helped me in the past when i have tried it    if you read all this  thanks  i just do not know what to do  and even for the  whatis  that i do know  i do not know the  hows for me  if that makes any sense ',\n",

me  i wake up with anxiety and go to sleep with anxiety  i have nothing that distracts me or makes me feel less stressed anymore  i feel alone and angry and upset  i have been fighting with my abusive mother lately which is making me feel worse than i already feel  i think she is a major contributing factor to my mental health decline but i guess there are other issues not limited to it running in her side of her family unfortunately for me i seem to have inherited mental issues my grandfather started having in his youth and so did my mother  my entire family is prone to mental health problems except my father whois family has none     i have dreams that bother me lately and i do not really tell anyone about them because i am worried what they will think of me  in some of my dreams where my sister or mother is trying to harm or kill me i sometimes harm or kill them while telling them what i feel about them and how they hurt me  i do not like having these dreams because i feel glee and relief when i am telling them how i feel or harming them in these dreams  granted they all seem iself defense  in these dreams but i do not like the feeling of happiness i get in these dreams  the feeling does not last when i wake up but i do not like having these dreams  i know i am not a violent person and despite them abusing me i d never hurt them irl but i do not like being left alone with my thoughts and no distractions  it makes me feel like a monster  my friends i have told said these are normal kind of dreams for abused people but it does not make me feel any less disgusted when i wake up     for the last few days my depression has gotten worse  i do not feel anything anymore  nothing makes me happy and nothing makes me have any feeling  i think i am completely desensitized to violent movies or similar stuff  nothing makes me feel anything anymore  crying  which i alternate between doing too much and not being able too makes me feel no relief     i have been an artistic

will get money to get my computer so that i can draw again like i used too  i feel like there is no hope that anything with change  the computer and the art are only part of my problems but i think i d have less issues if i had some kind of outlet for my depression  honestly the only reason i have not killed myself at this point is because i am far too unmotivated to actually do it  weather this is a good thing or not i do not know  who would even miss me  i am a useless meat sack with no value to anything     i have crippling medical anxiety as well and literally anything that even remotely cause me harm or pain makes me have a uncontrollable anxiety attack  have a chest ache probably caused from stress or too much caffeine  probably having a heart attack and dying  time to panic and no one will make me feel otherwise  been to the hospital over 10 times for shit like this     worst of all lartely when i have these panic attacks i hope they are actually what i think they are so they would kill me  they have not yet <neutralface> being terrified of dying and wanting to die at the same time is such a strange feeling     i have no outlets for my depression and feel nothing anymore

              " 'if you do not want to read this  you do not have to  i am just using this as a cathartic rant on the internet    you know how people write letters and then burn them for catharsis  well i am basically doing the same thing but posting in on a website in which i do not know anybody  this will most likely be my nonsensical ramblings connected with the thinnest thread of sanity  so if you do not want to read it or cannot make sense of it  then you can just move on with your day  i understand     so life sucks  i sure hope that was not the most surprising fact you have heard all day  but i am a mostly logical  agnostic person who believes that  yes  everything happens for a reason  but it is because of universal cause effects  and not because of any greater purpose by some benevolent god  if there is a god  then the most realistic portrayal of him would be as some neutral  omnipotent comedian  i mean that in the sense that our god finds comedy in the irony and injustice of the world    and then thereis the big question    why do good things happen to bad people and why do bad things happen to good people      from all i have seen with the world thus far in my admittedly short lifetime  the only god that could feasibly exist is a mischievous trickster who revels in the cosmic irony of injustice     yeah that was way too much of a philosophical rant  imma slow down     so i am a 17 year old male high school student who does not know a thing about life  i have just been fucked by and i am not sure how to move on  it almost seems like my entire life up to this point has been the worldis attempt to get rid of me    i felt like there was an unseen hand pushing me into pain and wanted to get rid of me  i wanted to agree with it     on september 23  i had attempted suicide due to people being assholes  basically  over the summer i had snuck out with a girl  who i will just refer to as reed  reed and i got into her car and started doing  stuff   i will leave it there because it does not need to be gone into  but the gist of it was that i am still a virgin    well afterwards  she told her friends about it  now to this day i do not know what she had told them  i do not know if she was the one who called it sexual assault  or if her friends started that vocabulary  although i am pretty sure of who it was  but i will get into that later   but anyways  now there were rumors being spread around that i had sexually assaulted and or raped reed  both of which are false  she had clearly  verbally consented multiple times  and if anything  she was very clearly being way more aggressive that i had  she is had lots of experience with this sort of thing and i am really just kind of the archetypal introverted  shy dude    her friends were now spreading around those false sexual assault rumors about me  saying to people that  they could tell anyone  but  do not tell op     i lost everyone without ever knowing why  i never had a ton of friends  but i still had some close people who would i talk to  but they avoided talking to me  some were more overt about their hatred for me than others  one of my closest friends who i would have died for at the time  i will be calling her bitch  made comments about me looking like a pedophile  now do not get me wrong  i will be the first one to say that i am no handsome devil  but i d admit that i am a decent 6 5 10  decently tall  not that skinny  no acne  and no resting bitch face    the other comment that someone made to me i did not understand at first  but it makes sense now  i did not know the rumors had been spreading for two months  this happened during this time  i was walking away from lunch when a popular girl stopped me  i have known her from my classes and she is the school staple of a friendly  kind face  she stuck her hand in front of me  pointed a piece of dirty ham on the ground and said   thatis the kind of person you are   i way completely taken aback  she walked away without making any sign that it had been a joke of some kind  i have thought about that moment a lot  i d tell myself   if even she knew  who else heard about it  and believed it    so a couple months pass and i am still not clued in by anyone about the rumors and the only thing i feel is that i am alone  at the time  i had never felt more lonely  my closest friend  who i will call tom  has been ignoring me for months now  i felt us growing distant and i wanted to know know  he told me the truth  he said that he had admittedly heard these rumors about me but did not know if he should believe them  so he just ignored me for the time  that was the first time i had heard about the rumors and i was pissed as hell  i was 100  percent convinced that reed had started the rumors   i confronted her about it at a football game that same day and she just broke down crying when i told her  she said that she did not mean for it to get as bad as it did and that it was her friends  which include bitch  who had been actually spreading the rumors  i said something along the lines of  it is been two fucking months  you should not have waited this long to tell me out it   we argued for a while  but eventually i left at like <lolface>m  when i had got home  i had heard that there were two dudes that had heard the argument  were coming to beat the shit out me  and had changed my words into  you should not care if you have been assaulted  it is been two months  you should be over it   i never said anything along those lines    i went home and drank alcohol for the first time  it was a cheap bottle of vanilla crown royal  i do not know why i drank it  it tasted like a mix of ethanol and pure vanilla extract  but it worked   the day afterward  i broke down hard  i cried for the first time in a while  i am a guy  so society has deemed it so that i cannot cry  so i usually do not  i hide my emotions to everyone  including my family  but even they asked me what was wrong  i did not say anything to them   that night i attempted suicide because i felt that the world wanted me dead  i did not want to be the rapist anymore  and if it worked then at least the truth would get out  people forgive anything with suicide  people can emphatically hate your guts one second  but when people bring up suicide  everyone forgives and says  oh you can talk to me   these people do not want you to talk to them  and they know that you will not reach out to them  but if they say that  then they can clear their mind of any guilt or shame if you kill yourself  people will not be sad if you die  yes maybe for a little while your family will be sad  but they will move on  at the end of grief is always acceptance  you cannot be sad forever  but you can be shameful and regretful forever  regret is the only eternal emotion  if you feel regret about what you could have done  then thatis the only feeling you will have for the rest of your life  sadness  fear  pain  even love are only ephemeral and will eventually fade  on someoneis death bed  when someone reflects on their own life  the most common emotion is regret  more so that sadness  fear  love  or happiness    i feel like thatis the only reason people try to comfort you  the fear of regret  people will put you through hell but as long as you do not kill yourself then they can keep a clean conscience  no one can understand you because no one gives a shit about you  as long as you are not suicidal then you are allowed to be as depressed as you want  as long as they treat the symptom of suicide then they can avoid the causes of mental illness  it is hypocritical bullshit     this is why i feel like i cannot talk to anyone about anything  i am feeling suicidal right now  but i do not even feel like i can turn to my family or friends  how are they supposed to understand what it is like going through several knives trying to find the one that cuts best  i know that the hair on my arm made it feel like cutting through a gritty  leathery sandpaper and i cannot think of anything else besides that    ironically i feel like the only person who understands me is reed  as she is a victim in this situation too  but talking to her just feels wrong  like the invisible guiding hand is telling me to get away from her                 i am mostly done with this but i will add a few more notes at the end    reed  bitch and her friend are all either bisexual or lesbian  and i believe that they created the rumors to push me away from her     bitch and reed were in an abusive relationship before  bitch being the abuser     bitch directly lied  saying to reed that she had told no one about the rumors  despite text screenshots that tom had sent me showing bitch telling tom the rumors    tldr  false sexual assault claims  suicide attempt  too many words  none of this is important',\n",

              " 'going to college really messed up my self esteem and self worth i feel like a shell of my former self   really just been having a bad past few days and thought screw  it why not post on here and a few other subs    i come from a very wealthy family from new york my father is a well known businessman throughout the area  i had a very good upbringing with very little issues was a social kid growing up and had plenty of friends  most of my friends growing up would tell me how they wish they had my life or where my sibling  back in 2012 i was a senior in high school  i know it is a joke to say that some people peaked in high school and i really think i actually have  back then i was a relativity liked kid i was captain of the wrestling and lacrosse teams the typical jock  i was mostly well liked by everyone and had no major issues  other than a few fights i did not start  i never really had a serious relationship then but  i had no trouble getting with girls or speaking to them  i never really thought of myself as good looking  but girls tell their friends they thought i was hot and would have no problem speaking to them and hooking with them or getting laid  as for grades i did pretty good in high school and got in a very good university in upstate new york  we can call x  that i was looking forward to attending my   entire life   until then  both of my grandparents meet at x and my both of my aunt and uncle went there too  i knew x was a very good school academic wise and carried a lot of weight     but what made me want to go x the most was party scene there one of the best of the country  it was known for its greek life as being the somone of wildest parties  however  around that time my parents marriage began falling apart as i began to learn about my fatheris infidelity with nemours women behind my moms back  i began partying way more on the weekends especially when i finished my high school sports  i soon became a huge pothead smoking weed as a way to cope with what was happening in my life and a way to rebel against my dad  however like anything too much is bad  i can admit i smoked way too much and it began to affect me socially and became known as stoner when i got to x for my freshman for my first semester freshman year it was undoubtedly the best time of my entire life and boy did i pay for it in the long run  as soon as i got there i made lots of friends in my dorms and found an easy connect for weed who grew  every night i was going to a different frat party frats invite freshman guys in begging to get them to join   hooking up with tons of hot girls and making new making friends  there was a group of guys all in my dorm i became friends with  one the guys got me really into working out and i got in pretty decent shape  however  that semester i might have had a great partying and hooking up with tons of girls    however towards the end of the semester i also got caught with weed in my dorm and was accused of being a massive dealer and was on the verge of getting thrown out of school  my parents were so pissed at me and threatened to pull me from x then i wish they did  i basically went to the schools version of a  north korean court trial with a bunch of the deanis staff and some professors  they used a bunch of false accusations from  witness in the dorms  that i had a major weed dealing operation which was total bullshit  at most i sold a few dub bags to my friends who were dry  they found no evidence of money  scales or baggies  they found a grinder in my desk with like a gram in it  but this one dean there really had it out for me  because my family over the years gave the school boat loads of money  it would but the school in a sticky situation if they threw me out   that if they did they would lose scholarships and donations that my family supported  so the people in the north korean style banana court did they best they could to make my life miserable there i would have no choice but to quit and transfer out  they were going to move me to a dorm which is for foreign transfer students for the rest of my freshman year  i had a room all for myself in the basement floor which they could easily watch me and surveill  i was 3 miles off campus that i had to take a bus to class everyday  i had to be in the dorm in my room by 10pm during the week and 11pm on weekends unless i had permission slips from my community service  which i had to do 165 hours of  lastly i was forbidden from doing a fraternity from my entire time at x  if failed to listen to any of these absurd rules i was thrown out of x  i begged my parents to let me leave x but they were so upset i got in trouble there  they said i needed to stay or it would cause problems with my family      when i came back for the next semester i learned mostly all of my guy friends did the rush and i had a falling out with them  i was not able to hangout with them because they made me move dorms  and i had to be back by curfew  plus i had to work for the house of daniels christian charity  for my community service  which i hated i was jewish and they kept trying to convert me  i soon had less and less people to hangout with other then my local weed dealer who did not go to school at x  i realized that if you are not part of greek life  sports teams are in with the super rich asians if you go to school at x your social life is basically dead or non existent  soon all the girls i hooked up with the previous semester all rushed sororities  when i would see a girl who i had sex with the previous semester and spoke with frequently  they would ignore me when i would walk by them on campus and not even look at me  i never felt so awkward and embarrassed before in my entire life  what also made it worse is that when i got into s  i barely got in because its hard school academically  i was not even in the major i wanted to be in real estate   i soon began there was nothing left for me at x and i didnt want to be there anymore  i was not having a good time   the social butterfly inside me was pissed i was going to be there while every was doing the rush and making new friends  i was never the lone wolf type always on a sports team and had friendships  x is also in a very snowy aerea and i soon began to felt like a prison of snow  what also made it worse that x is in some run down rust belt city with a high crime rate  i felt so trapped and wanted to transfer out  i was able to finish my freshman second semester thanks to going to the gym everyday and working out like a madman  that summer after my freshman year i once again begged my parents and they said no  you have to go back      i did not pick a dorm for my sophomore year because i wanted to transfer   i was finally free and could live where i want did not have a curfew  i got picked a  random roommate because i did not know anyone  i got picked with tk an asian kid whos straight off the boat from japan and spoke broken english  i dorm live far from campus but i could smoke in my dorm because there were no ra  by sophomore year my only hope was to get into the real estate school at x so i could learn it before i worked for my family business  my life was at the beginning of my sophomore year was revolved around going to class and getting good grades  which i did i made deans list for the rest of my time at s   going to the gym which i did compulsively it was the way i physically let out all my anger of being at x and noting being able to do the greek life there and being stuck there and i got pretty jacked got my deadlift to 605  squat 455 and 365 bench  tk began to warm up to me and start smoking weed eventually and i had someone to sort of hangout with  i did not go to the school gym because all the greek life kids ran it and i felt embarrassed going alone  i went to a local gym in x which mostly people form the inner city went to  i was the only white kid there and stuck out like a sore tump  but everyone was kind to me and there was some very strong people there who motivated me to get better  i made friends with someone of the people at the gym and they invited me to their parties only went to a few   i would brink tk and we would hang out with the inner city people form the gym in the projects but we only did on occasion  i found it funny how my parents were sending me an elite private university and i would go to the hood to hangout instead my own school  i soon learned that i could not switch into the real estate major because of my prior offenses my freshman year getting caught with weed  my uncle who is on the alumni board of the real estate school could not even push me in  i was so upset because i wanted to go to x my entire life and it was all in shambles  my life revolved around going to class  smoking weed and the gym  i basically had no social life outside of it and was not involved with anything else at x because nothing else interested me there  it was a jail i then became angry and then very depressed for the rest of my time there using the gym and weed as my outlet for my anger and sadness  i saw pictures on social medial of guys who i was friends with freshman year killing it in the frats partying with the hottest girls  while i was at home on a friday night smoking a bong playing xbox with tk  being the person who i was in high school i could never see this happening to myself i was always with the  in  crowd and never had any if much with trouble with girls  now i was the outcast and it hurt so much  i had to lie to all my friends from home and family i liked it at x going to school there  but in reality i hated the place more than any other on earth  it got especially hard before my senior year  tk was abroad that semester and were not moving into a house until the second semester  i was forced to live in a dorm and it was so hard seeing all the freshman move in all happy on my floor while i was there as a senior was gut wrenching to watch  i was so upset at my parents for sending me back up there  i was like a hermit who liked in my room and only left for class  gym and getting weed  i staying in my dorm room the entire time playing xbox live with kids i met from online     i went back home for the summer after a horrible semester to beg my parents to let me leave x  they simply would not let me do it it was so upset  my father told me he did not want to upset my grandma and the rest of my family and it would cause problems  but that summer at home was fun i was social and went to lots of parties and hooked up with a few girls i felt like my old self again  i did not sign up for housing that year because i thought i was going to transfer home to my local community college till i figured out what i wanted to do     i really hated going to school at x i completely understand it was my fault and put myself completely in that situation  however  i was very pissed at my parents for making me stay there after i got my grades up  i understand it would have pissed off the rest of my family  but i was so depressed and hated every single day there i felt like i was not event a real student at x  i just went there for classes and lived in a shitty rust belt city where i smoked and played xbox all day  gone was the once charismatic person who loved to be socialize and party and became something i was not  but what was the most hurtful part was on the inside i was the same person  it was killing me knowing there where tons of good memories i could have been having like how college was supposed to be   i was like going to an amusement park watching tons of people having fun and not being allowed to go on any of the rides  you just saw everyone else having a good time while i was left standing there with my dick in my hand  the only time i ever really back then would party and hook up with girls was when i went back home on breaks and during the summer again made x feel like a prison to me  the only thing keeping me going at school was the gym  weed and knowing the faster i get a degree the faster i get out of x     eventually i graduated with honors and got into a really good mba program in nyc with a concentration in real estate finance  doing the mba program i feel so much better and it feels good to have a social life again but i admit sometimes i hold on to old habits with staying in   but i feel like i missed out on the prime years of my life and have lots of regret and way more anger  i find that because of the way i lived in x many of my social and interpersonal skills with other people has rapidly declined  i hate to use this word but my game  with girls is non existent  i finally now i am starting to get laid again more regularly but it is only because drunk girls think im hot in their words  because i spent the past 5 years working out like a madman  but i cannot keep any girls for long because i have the social skills and game of a four year old  i still have so much anger towards my parents for making me stay at x too  at the time they said i had to learn from my lesson  but they knew i was miserable  i still feel a lot of trauma from going to school at x ',\n",

fucked up than i actually am and if it is okay here i d like to get it off my chest and talk about my life and where i am now to no one in particular   i was never the popular kid  i was known but never popular  i was the kid that got picked last for sports or games  never got to play soccer with the other kids because i wasnt good enough  wasnt included in tag or hide and go seek  but i pressed on not knowing what the other kids were bullying me  i got to play lego or slap jack  tic tac toe  you name it  i played by myself  i had about 3 or 4 friends for most of primary school  kindergarten grade 3   not knowing how to interact with the other kids i was lonely  i didnt realize i was lonely as it was well normal for me  the world was out to get me and i let it  i had no voice  i didnt know how to stand up to myself for fear of hurting the other person for telling them how i felt  i was never taught how to show emotions or how to use them  interpret them  i know what they look like and how they feel but showing them  using them  you would have better luck getting a volcano to spew water  but this is how i was brought up and its what i knew  life for me was like looking through beer goggles for everyone else it was distorted and i had a fake image of what it was  because of this i matured faster in other aspects of life  i grasped adult concepts earlier than most and grew into them  into worrying about what others think of me  always comparing myself to everyone else  not just the best or the people above me but everyone  i felt like everyone hated me and thought i was some annoying kid so i shut myself off from the world  thatis the first few years of life  i ran around as a  happy  lonely kid  as i grew up and was about 10 or 11 i learned to read people and guess what they were feeling thinking  how their day was going n shit  i learned to feed off of everyone is emotions around me rather than feeling my own  i essentially shut off my own emotions without realizing it and now i am struggling with fixing it  i fed off of the kids that were happy and replicated their happiness as my own  i imitated them and copied them to feel included  i grew up like this trying to fill that big empty lonely hole i felt  i buried it deep down and  as a green swamp friend of mine once said  i became an onion  i made layers to try to hide it but nothing seemed to work   sorry this post has kinda became a pity party it was not my intention  fuck it let us continue  the next couple years of my life pretty much continued on like this  building my wall of fake emotions to  protect  everyone else from my greatest enemy    myself  i didnt trust myself to not fuck up  didnt trust myself to really connect with anyone  i lied to everyone around me and pushed anyone away that tried to get close or learn who really was on the inside  it was repulsive and wrong but i didnt know that  i would say this is when i got my first taste of depression around the age of 12  grades 5 7 i was the class runt guinne pig doormat  i was the kid being bullied  the other kids unanimously decided i was the kid they picked on  fucking private religious bullshit school did nothing to prevent what they were doing to me nor did they seem to care hell even the teachers  would pick on me  so i accepted  who i was  and that was the school fuck up  i tried to take their name tag and wear it with pride  yea it worked for a bit as armor  i made myself insensitive to the bullying for the first little bit  but grade 6 is when the smack down really started to happen and i became    the germ  these kids had gotten the idea to give me the permanent cheese touch or the germ as they liked to call it  this was the tipping point for me  all my so called classmates and friends i had suddenly turned on me and i was alone  truly alone  left half dead for the vultures to pick at  i broke  i broke into so many little pieces  all those people i grew up around people i trusted turned  i could not touch anyone with out them screaming  dont touch me germ   great thanks now i have to wash myself  and other hurtful shit like that  they could not even sit in a chair i had used without washing it and sanitizing it  okay i say i was alone but i had 2 friends  payton and dane  they tried to help they tried everything they could but the other kids would not back down  half way thru the school year i attempted suicide  i had the steak knife pointed at my heart and started pushing  i drew a little blood but it hurt to much so i stuck around  i had only told dane and he kept it quite for a while like i asked him to but one day he told me that he had to tell the teacher  it wasnt something he liked knowing and didnt like how close i was to not being here  so he told that i wasnt feeling good in my head  that i was going thru some tough times due to the class and what they were doing  this teacher had 0 clue that it was happening and immediately went to the principal  brought me with her and told me to tell her what was going on  i played dumb for so long hoping that it would just end  i didnt want to deal with it but they persisted and eventually brought dane in and asked him what was up  after he started to say something i broke  i told them almost everything  about me wanting to die  not wanting to live and how i wished everyone else would die first  i didnt tell them how i had attempted suicide  my worst fears had come true  i spoke up and now everyone hated me  they could not bully me but did they hate me  after the whole class got a ripped a new ass hole for pushing a kid to suicidal thoughts  yes i told them i had thoughts  no i didnt tell them i tried  i came back into the class room and i am greeted with silence and stone cold eyes staring back at me  the first thing this kid told me  who i thought was one of the people that i had as an acquaintance   you know op fuck you  you go and cry to the principal that we dont treat you nicely well guess what  you want us to treat you with dignity and respect well how about trying to treat us that way  next time think before you speak   i cannot tell you how much this affected me  that kid got sent home for the rest of the week  this is supposed to be where that part of the story ends right  no those fuckers came back the next and kept calling me the germ  kept bullying me and bullied me harder than before  grade 7 was a repeat of grade 6  aging more and more i hid more and more of my emotions and just kept feeding off others and relying on them for how to react in different situations  elementary school behind me and moving to middle school i made new friends  a new chapter in life  friendsthat didnt judge  one guy even had the same name as me  mysteriouslyreddited   i started to notice girls at this point too  two girls in particular  quinn and anna  quinn is a couple years younger than i had been babysat by my mother and i by her mother  they switched out as they both worked  and she  well quinnis amazing  pretty no beautiful  shes got these eyes that just  her hair    wow  and her smile        just everything  she was my first crush although quickly forgotten  we went to different schools  you know out of sight out of mind  k not like that but i had not seen her in a while   anna on the other had  well i can describe her similarly  but things were different with anna  they were  easier    its  well she was the girl i fell head over heels for and she knew it  we talked for hours upon hours but it was never meant to be  i continued on the same way i did in elementary school  by wearing armor and growing my onion  anna and i stayed close for a couple years me being wrapped around her finger while she went after other guys  i got her a couple boyfriends reluctantly  i introduced her to a couple guys i knew she was crushing on and i enjoyed watching her be with them  as i look back i was feeding off of her boyfriends emotions and mixed them with my own  bad idea 0 10 would recommend   and well this went as well as you may guess  it went great  wrong  i was confused and shut off  shut down and shot down  i do not remember what started a fight between us but it went on for months  it became personal for the both of us  i told her not to come to my funeral she told me to fuck off and go die  words were said damage was done and i thought i was okay with it  i learned quickly that i in fact was not okay and my fight with her had broken my armour and i was bare  everything was out and we both fell into depression because of what we did to each other  i was having more and more suicidal thoughts  i had spiraled to my lowest point that i have ever been  self harm  alchohol  skipping school  it was the worst part of my life  highschool is the hardest for everyone isnt it   its not oof my bad  i was skipping school  fighting with my mothers husband  smoking pot and drinking waaaaay to much booze  the fall out of not having anna in my life was ruining me  yes i felt for her and yes i wanted her back in my life but the hatred for her at the same time was almost outweighing the good i felt for her  i cut everyday for over 2 years  i didnt know what to do  the pain felt good and brought me out of my head and prevented me about thinking about anything as long as the blade was on me  my entire depressive episode was brought on because i could not stand up for myself or tell myself it is okay or when to stop  i lost myself  lost my armor  lost everything  or at least i thought i lost everything when in reality i was only just discovering life  i became cold and truly shut off my emotions and didnt even feed off others  i became a robot  i woke up late went to school skipped all my classes  went home played cod or skyrim and went to bed  rinse repeat and thatis how i lived from day to day  month to month  for a couple years  i still have not reconnected with anna  anna if you end up reading this im sorry for the bad memories  i like to think that we still have some love left for each other but i know thatis false   as i lived like this my family life started to become stretched and strained  being brought up as a christian i was told to believe in god  that hes the answer to all and just ask him for help  i called bullshit and that if he truly cared that none of us would suffer  if we suffer then why the fuck did jesus die on the cross for us  my grandparents and mother didnt take kindly to these words and how dare i speak about god in that manor  after mass one sunday i would have been like 15 we were at the grandparents and the topic of vacations came up and how i had not been on one in years and i d like to go when peeps went down to visit cousins from another town a days drive away  it was spring break and they were leaving next weekend  i inquired if i could go with them and because of my grades i was told no  i told them if they let me go i d pick up the pace in school and i would try  but only if they let me go  well my attitude needed to be fixed because the next thing i know my mother is yelling at me and telling me how entitled i am and that id be lucky to consider even going  me being the teen i was i yelled back  fuck yous were exchanged  my grandfather had enough and tried to manhandle me  no fucking chance gramps not in my current state  we had a fist fight that ended up with him having broken glasses  he litterally ripped my shirt off me  ripped my necklace off and threw me into a door and him thrown onto the floor  he got up and started to yell  get the fuck out of here  you can come back when your damn well ready to apologize until then get out       i replied with  well then i guess it wasnt nice knowing you  when you are ready to get your grandson back track me down and tell me how sorry you are  and left without looking back  he did track me down the next day and told me he was sorry about how he reacted and stepping so far out of line  that night after we made up and got a blizzard i went home to find my motheris husband fuming because of how i talked to my mother which cause a fight with him  that was the night i lost my home  my family  he had disowned me and cast me out like garbage  even tho that was one of my lowest points i didnt see it as a loss  yea i was fucked but i was also free to do what i want when i want  so i started working on myself  i moved to a new city enrolled in a new school and started fresh  while i did climb out of my depressing hole i have yet to beat depression  i got a great girlfriend and living large now adays   started some anti depressants  counseling and what not  well now im going to skip ahead to why i wanted to get some baggage off my back  a few weeks ago i went out to the bar with some friends and i ran into none other than quinn  i d had some pregame drinks  had some drinks while i was there  i didnt eat anything that day  was already dehydrated and alcohol should not be consumed like that while on meds  so i was already drunk  feeling great  i d seen quinn once and didnt know what to say so i just smiled and  ignored  her  well let me tell you it was so fucking hard to ignore her  i mean if you were me you would find it impossible to  so i did what any drunk man does  i had a shot and approached her  asked if i could buy her a drink and  from what i remember we hit it off  i had a blast but tbh i was not looking for anything in her i just remembe how i used to feel but more importantly j remembered all the fun times we use to have growing up and all the memories with her over the years  i was   no i am lonely and she seemed to just kinda be there  so we were talking  and i looked at her and time just seemed to stop  we talked but i do not remember what it was about  at one point i asked if i could kiss her  my self conscience was screaming at me telling me this was not okay but the alchohol was in too deep  there is so much that i wish i could remember about that night but i cant  i dont know what happened what i said or did  this is the hardest i have had to fight this depression in a long time and this time i am worried that i will not be able to win  i do not recognize who i am anymore  i dont like this person i have become  i love my gf but i feel like i am going to drag her down and make her depressed like me  i feel like i am not good enough for her and i am hurting her by being with her  i cant stop thinking about quinn but i think i fucked up even trying to be friends with her  there was a small spark there but nothing major besides i dont want there to be a spark right now  i have talked to my gf and she knows i have feelings for another  it was hard to deal with at first but after we talked about it she knows that im struggling with my feelings and that i am not looking for a way to leave her  i have been on the verge of relapsing and going back to self harm  im not crossing that line because when i do thereis no turning back  im tired of being depressed and i want out but he hardest part is figuring out who i am and if i can keep all my current bridges or if i have to go out and build new bridges  im going to keep trudging on and finding my way thru this fucked up place we call earth  again im sorry this was so long and all over the place  if you read it thanks for listening  if you skip over this story thanks for not wasting your time  that came out wrong but ov well   i am not looking for help i just need to talk to someone',\n",

questions  i finished the exam in 10 minutes  i knew it was wrong  no one would be bothered to all this  i only remember one part from it  i guess it was the iq test  i was looking at my friend to cheat  i did not think the way he did  i do not know why did he think that  i also remember the question  it is been a while  i scored higher than all of my people somehow  it was 110  i had no understanding of iq meant and i did not even know what was that number  i did not even know what was that exam  i feel like i never joined in it  we all scored about 105 110  i am just ahead with 2 points  i was cringe  i think i was not completely aware of how my brain does  i never thought about it  i was happy  i was really happy  no one was hitting my head  my friends were treating me good  my grades were top  the economy was good  i was good  i was school 1st for one time  literally one time lol  i was able to do all math by my head when i was that age  i guess i still can but i also think i am stupid  i cannot do any of the new math problems  i do not understand my teachers  they just explain and go on  explaining 5 minutes  solving 35  i remember  i can see how people see me  no

remember i imagine  i can  i cannot remember  it is only for the time i am doing it  i am 13 yo  do not take me seriously  i cannot even talk proper english  i do not want anyone i know to find about this  i am sad  i lied about my age for a while  no one ever suspected me until i told the truth  my friend did not unfriend me  he is still there  i love him  he thinks i am smart but it is not the reason i love him  he can understand  why is it so fucking hard to understand  why is it so fucking scary to live  i feel like i am seeing something all night  i want to play chess  i am bad at it

it feels like you are living in it  you read the other  it is bad  it does not feel like you are living in it  the answer is 2nd  to the question which asks you which one of those makes you feel live in it  the answer is all because 2 3 stupid words  quite good  i have to remember all of those useless shit  i will not even use any of them  i do not care  i never did  i will not  i have the big exam after 4 months and i did not even study a bit for 4 years  i cannot  it is boring  should i  i think i am going to  i will get a pc if i do so  thatis the only reason why i have to  my pc is bad

 he will be sad  i do not want to get my dad sad  i get angry but i do not want to get anyone sad  i feel sad  i feel bad  i do not think i am feeling good  the only thing that would motivate me is a

want to if they did not  i do not want to live stupid  i cannot laugh at what you laugh at  the fake smile hides it all  i think i am a clown  i want to change  i cannot  it is hard but i keep doing

if you are reading though thatis for caring enough   so i grew up in a suburban area which was really a gated community of really nice people  outside my housing estate however was basically a ghetto but it was not always like that  it gradually turned worse and eventually my family moved our after my mom was even scared to walk to the shops on her own  anyway i had like 3 best friends i will use fake names cause i am paranoid even though it is impossible they read this  brian james and hassan  so as a kid i always viewed myself as cool and was easy going and had quite a lot of friends  from ages 6 12 i had a great life and have found memories of playing with brian james and hassan  james always thought brian was weird and he was right brian was very weird but in this enclosed community it was impossible to not be friends with someone because we were all we had  when i was 12 i developed hyperhidrosis a condition where your sweat glands are over active and you basically sweat buckets for no reason all the time  this was really distressing for me as a kid at 12 and i always had to change two sometimes three t shirts a day when playing outside  when i entered high school  secondary school whatever you want to call it i became friends with many new people  i used to get insulted and mocked for my friend group because they were all weird in everyone is eyes but my own  i ruthlessly cut off my whole friend group and after a year of no friends i found a new friend group  over time i slowly acknowledged how weird my old friends were and genuinely think most of them either have autism or other social mental illnesses  i felt really bad when i cut my friends off but i did it regardless and the whole dynamic of the housing estate changed  i forgot how i did not have any friends outside of school and spent every minute of every day inside doing nothing feeling like a asshole  they used to walk around the estate constantly and always look in my windows as a jest to see if i was still on my own  maybe it was justified but all the same i was pretty miserable  i got invited to a party which you had to be a cool kid to go to and i did not understand party attire so i went up in tracksuit bottoms and bright green running asics shoes  everyone wearing jeans and whatever i got completely humiliated and it was like out of a movie i literally had everyone laughed at me looking me dead in the face i was so utterly crushed i went to a room where no one was and i sat on a couch by myself pretending to flick through my phone  i eventually went into the bathroom and called my mom to collect me early and i really held back the tears in the car home  all my supposed new friends had humiliated me and my old friends would not take me back i was completely alone  from ages 13 16 i used to stay at home all day everyday and i developed a really bad depression  i was completely numb and it was to the point where i could not even react to anything to evoke any emotion i felt like a robot  i spent my days in bed go downstairs to eat something back to bed  i developed a love for anime and tbh if i did not have anime i defiantly would have killed myself  i had a lot of suicidal thoughts brewing for years until finally i tried to take my like  i twisted two metal coat hangers around my neck hooked them up to my rack thingy in my closet that was up high and hung mysel  luckily the bar broke and my mom came running up the stairs like wtf and i just told her i was trying to do pull ups and broke the bar  i would get invited to social gatherings like playing football by my new friends ever so often especially at the start but i had developed such anxiety of going out and my sweating problem got so bad i could not wear any colors that would show sweat stains  the invites eventually stopped but in hindsight these friends were very shallow and i did not have any clothes that were hip or fashionable so i 100  would have gotten ridiculed badly  i also developed a love for music especially rap and rnb  i have a specific memory of staying up all night crying my eyes out because i was so lonely and broken and i just wanted to die really and i got out of bed and was banging the back of my head against my drawer and scraping my legs and cutting my thighs and all this  anyway i had a huge moment where i just snapped and i had a huge hatred of everyone who did me wrong  i promised myself to live just so i could prove everyone wrong and i just hated them so much  i left that fake friend group and after a year of loneliness i found a genuine one that i played playstation with all the time  it suited me because i had too much anxiety to go out and around this time i started talking to girls on snapchat and insta etc  i became a really toxic person and i would go out of my way to lead girls on to then just fuck them off when i got bored  it gave me this power which i never really ever had and it was addictive  i played sports and went to the gym and i became really funny because i was fat my whole life and when your fat the only way for people to like you is if you are funny  so everyone started to treat me normal and thatis where we are today  today i am 18 years old and now my depression is back and it is affecting me so much i am unable to do my studies  it is bad because i have my state exams in a couple months well maybe not because of corona virus but still i have gained a lot of weight from the stress of exams and i just have no meaning in my life no goals i wanted to become a psychologist and help others but by the time i would be qualified to help others with my own practice i would be 34 years old i cannot live in my parents house for another 16 years  my other option was to become a barrister and study law but i already know i will not like it and i am just applying for it for the status and it is eating me inside  i have no amitbion to do anything anymore and i really just want to die and be done of any decision making i do not want to get up at 8 am and study i do not want to go to school and out on the same fake laugh fake demeanour i have most of my teenage years    any advice if anyone actually read this would be very helpful   this could be a cry for help but really i am old enough to acknowledge that i do not think i will ever get rid of this depression and probably will have it for the rest of my life   thanks anyway for the platform to express myself',\n",

              " 'much happier girl now    hi guys  for the last couple years i was super depressed and it was hard finding people to talk to because they would not see it as a problem  either girls would tell me they wish they had that problem or guys would contribute to the problem for the most part    i do not want come off as narcissist but people find me very attractive and my larger chest area does not help  i realized since i was perhaps a freshman in high school  senior guys inviting me to parties  male teachers giving me special privileges and occasionally their eyes would wander away from my face  i did not really see a huge problem until i got to college  i wanted to date  find a nice guy to treat me right and i found it was super hard    the majority of guys that i talked to were not looking for anything more than a hookup  some guys respected the fact that i did not want a hookup but the majority of guys would go along and pretend to want more when in reality they did not  when i would ask to get to know each other more before we do anything  i d be called a tease  accused of leading them on and told hurtful stuff like  i am sure other guys have been in your pants  why cannot i get some  do you know how hurtful that is  and eventually  complements meant nothing to me  i d get so many and they all felt sexual in nature  they were all based off my looks and nothing more    guys with girlfriends were a lot of times the worst  if they saw me talking to their boyfriends  they would get super jealous  if we are studying for a test together  they assumed i am trying to take their man  i would never try to get in between someoneis relationship and if your boyfriend decides to flirt with me  i will do my best to make him know i am not interested but i am not responsible for his actions so do not get upset at me  and a lot of girls would just seem to be in competition with me and i am not  or some of them would make it seem as if they are worshiping me and it just felt weird    then things got worst how people assumed things i get stuff based off my looks strictly  like i am not going to lie people have given me special treatment but i have never requested it and i have never depended on it  i have always been dedicated to working hard and earning what i want  i remember my sophomore year i was taking a number theory class which is harder than it sounds  i took a test  the mean score was about a 55  and i got a 91  and a girl claimed i got a high grade based of my looks  i studied hard for that  i tried to get a group together where she was invited and she declined  on my test  the problems were done correctly  and she claimed it was based of my looks  that was just so hurtful    as time went on it just bothered  and i became depressed off of it based off the idea that i did not think i could ever find love  i am a start girl  pretty but i felt like i could not find a guy to talk to where the topic of sex or my boobs did not come up before a couple conversions  it just felt like thatis all guys saw me for  and i know looks fade as time go  i do not want a guy who just has sex with me then goes and brags to his friends  or realizes that i will not always be this pretty and move on to another girl eventually  and i could not talk to people  girls would always say they wish they had that as a problem  and guys would always  listen  and the next week they are asking for pictures of my breast  and my family did not make things better either always asking why i do not have a boyfriend  it must be so easy for me    that just always bothered me and brought me down significantly  i was never in a great state of depression but it was something that was just there and it was hard to talk to someone  that was something that bothered me until last year    one day my car battery died at school and a friend and i were outside for about thirty minutes trying to jumpstart it  but she drove a weird jeep and you had to unscrew stuff to get to the battery so we were there for a while  eventually this guy came but and asked if we needed help  he has a portable battery in his car  i assumed he was just another guy trying to get into my pants  but that was not the case  he came over and actually helped  he knew what he was doing  we talked a bit afterwards  found out we used to live in the same area  he is a volunteer firefighter in the town over now and he is an economics major with a math minor  then he said he had to go  he did not get my name or ask for my snapchat like most guys do    there was just something about him  the way he was super kind to do this gesture for me without expecting nothing in return  i was somewhat attracted to him  luckily  i started seeing him on campus all the time and we would wave to each other  eventually i got brave enough to go and talk to him and i did  we became friends and started talking a lot  he was super kind  funny and a weird sense of charisma  and i started realizing just how handsome he was along with his super muscular bodies  one thing led to another and we have been dating since then  this man treat me right  makes me so happy  makes me feel cared for and for much more than my body  every conversation is not just about sex  he actually listen to me  asks about my dreams and aspirations and i feel so comfortable around him  every once in a while i do catch his eye wandering away but with him  i do enjoy it and sometimes his eyes would stay there a bit longer after i catch him haha  his complements mean much more to me  because they feel genuine and much more than something to get into my pants  i love this guy a lot  and i generally do not advocate for getting into relationships to fix depression  but i am this specific case it helped me  i am so happy with him and i could see us lasting and i would like it to and he feels the same  but at the same time i do know that if for some unfortunate reason we do not work out at the very least there are great guys out there ',\n",

              " 'bipolar disorder does not make sense to me  other personal thoughts   experiences i have  etc   for example  how is one supposed to differentiate  episodes  of mania   hypomania states from depressive states as a distinct problem vs having highs and lows caused by other things such as ritualistic coping mechanisms that influence personality  like if the way someone functions is relatively stable  hence in relation to having a  personality disorder   then how is one supposed to make a qualitative distinction between how someone with bipolar disorder should behave like   think like   function like who does not have a personality disorder vs someone who does not have bipolar disorder but does have a personality vs someone who has both   let us just say      as someone who is not diagnosed with bipolar disorder of any type   instead have schizotypal personality disorder and major depression   but whom has met and been around many people who have had it for many years  probably the majority of them being the case in mental health groups  what i never seem to understand is this whole state dependent thing  like you either randomly become manic   hypomanic or you become  depressed   it is as if environmental issues   other factors do not play a significant role or do not need to at all  and it is simply a come and go thing thatis 100 percent biological  it is often very evident in the way they talk  like when i am in a depressive  state   it is difficult to do things  and if i am in a manic state  we will i am doing things in stereotypical manners     and a lot of people could say  we will  it is like the whole spectrum way of looking at things  and that it only becomes a disorder if there is enough symptoms or impairment to start being considered one  but thatis a problem  because it does not look at why the person is the way they are and it is assuming that what the person is expressing or functioning like is the same thing as another    often when i d go to the dbsa groups  they would use a scale  and eventually i became tired of giving a number  because neither numbers would fit my types of problems  if i said i was a low enough number  it would suggest that i should be in the hospital   i had to clarify a more specific number to indicate what would be more  realistic  when really the bipolar scale just was not applicable to me    and if i suggested something in the high range  it would suggest that i am manic or have some form of mania  when it is not  so much an issue  that i d be concerned about other people suggesting me to go take of my mental health first  because they are too dumb to realize anything more complex  for example  agitation   anxiety   irritability   or restlesness would be considered as leaning towards mania  yet when you look at many research  it shows that those with unipolar depression can have all these issues  but that does not make them have any sort of bipolar disorder      you know  agitated depression would be an example    now this is just my personal observation   opinion  but i feel like bipolar disorder is a combination of biological and personality caused condition  where it can only occur in certain people with certain personality   psychological traits and biological influences  the reason why i say this is because pretty much everyone i d meet or seen  as well as what research has shown about these individuals  as well as observing the nature of the condition itself  has shown that the type of problem in bipolar disorder is more specific to certain types of people with certain types of genes  and so what i am trying to say is that it would not be correct or logical to just say that everyone can develop disorder  regardless of personality and genetic associations  and neither would it make sense for many other disorders    and so it is really irritating when people just wan t to generalize or give a statement such as we will  just because your experience was like that  does not mean it cannot be like this  like they are not actually factoring in what i said and coming up with an explanation that could provide some kind of reasoning that would answer my question in a more careful conscientious manner    like you could say  hmm     thatis a good point  i am not sure  i guess it could be like this or that       but the thing is  from all these bipolar people i met and talked to  both in person and online  it was not like that at all  and that was with most of them being medicated too        and i never found someone who was different than the big 5 research either or mbti faceats in relation to bipolar related disorders  including schizoaffective disorder bipolar type  all of them were either nis   ps and   or low on conscientiousness   high openness to experience  either low or high on agreeableness  low or high on extroversion    high on  neuroticism        also as a random inference  what i noticed is that borderline pd co occurred in a large proportion of these bipolar disordered people  and i did not find that surprising because the same has been shown in other  research   and many of these people  if not majority of them i should say benefit well from the same types of treatments of  typical  people  like if they were qualitatively differently functioning people that much  they would not be benefiting so well or have such good outcome  particularly in the same domains of  typical  people  yet they do and my experiences with them were more or less similar  their personalities although not all the same were more alike than different    i use to think i had borderline pd before i was diagnosed with schizotypal pd  until i realized i am not like those who actually are diagnosed with borderline pd at all  and i do not even wan t to associate myself with them either  but then again  i do not relate to the majority of people with schizotypal pd either  so much that i do not think i even have schizotypal pd  it seems like the only logical solution would be personality disorder nos  but whois going to get support for that    i have tried raising similar questions and viewpoints in various threads  reddit  psychforums  mentalhealthforums  and other places  but i just do not have anyone else who shares the same experiences as me or thinks   functions the same way  and even if they do  we will they unfortunately suffer more  silently  and are not as visibly discernible  but i know that would not be true  because if they really were like me  i d bump into more of them making the same types of points  you know  i rarely give casual generalized responses  my hope is to find a personality disorder support group in person that is not focused on borderline pd  since the only ones out there largely focus on those who have borderline pd  which again  i see them closer to those with bipolar disorder than those with actual personality disorders      but i guess my definition is a bit broad  i will say that i never met someone who had vulnerable narcissism or paranoid pd  i mean   tons of people with paranoid schizophrenia but disorders that had paranoia in terms of relating to their personality  nada      and even if i did  they were not like me  and their paranoia was more or less the same type found in schizophrenia ',\n",

condition was that i had to get a job that paid  30 000 a year  i got another job where i worked and i got the pay i needed  it seemed like the paper work for this permit was pretty straightforward  i filled out the form till the last section  it was about how this job was advertised  the charity that i worked in advertised it on their website  i applied for the job and had an interview and everything  i was not just given this job under any circumstances  i earned it  now  what the government wanted was this job to be advertised on very specific platforms like a national newspaper and radio for 2 weeks and a website for job seekers to give them the best chance to apply for this job    i asked my workplace if they would be happy to advertise this job again  i would apply for it  or if they were happy to get in touch with the immigration department on my behalf  since they are the biggest charity of that country  and try to seek some help  they out right refused  i was given a letter that said that my job contract was only valid till 14 12 2019 because that is the day my visa expired as well  they would extend it if i got a valid visa extension   i went to a solicitor  he said that i would waste around  3000 on this visa application  there was only a 5  chance that would get the visa  i will not get a refund on the application fees and the visa officers take this advertisement clause seriously and i do not meet the criteria  he asked me to get in touch with my workplace again and see if they are willing to advertise it again  they denied again    my fiance and i do not necessarily have the money to get married right now  it also does not feel right to get married just for a visa  i know it would be the easier way out but this is not why we want to get married    we decided to move to canada in 2020  because he is from that european country  he is okay in terms of canada visas  he already got his visa  my visa to his country expired in december 2019

live in  my family is falling apart though  celebrating festivals will never be the same  my brother and i will not have one permanent home anymore  we will always visit our parents separately   i

friends accusing me of how i have made him spend all this money  how he will never get it back  how i have made him a poor man  i have said it to him that i will start paying him back as soon as i start working  my fiance is also back in his home country  working and saving up for our move    he is a brilliant partner  he came to see me in my country for about 3 weeks  he looks after me  knows what i am going through and he is always there to talk to me or just be sad with me  i do not mind the distance between us  it is only for a few months    but i am hopeless about everything else in my

look like shit  had quite a few friends  lots of activities  a girlfriend that i lived with  did not have a high paying job but i liked the place  life was great apart from my girlfriend cheating on me a couple of times   one time it was  purely emotional cheating   other time a  drunk kiss   nothing too bad  right  easy to forgive and move on  well    you still have to cry a lot  hear out a lot of apologies   make a decision  which you have already made because you are madly in love  but you have to at least pretend that you are comprehending the whole situation and thinking about leaving her  so she knows the risk  in fact you are not thinking about anything  you have already made your decision  life is going to suck for several weeks  months  you will have some trust issues but you you will get through this  right  right   for a while everything seems fine  amp  wonderful  seems like everythingis back to normal  stormis over  but it is different  weather is not so sunny like it used to  you still feel loved and you still love her but this stuff is still lingering in the back of your mind  you can hide it under your smile  under love and passion  but it is there  and it eats you from the inside whenever you are alone with your thoughts   until you get another hit right in your face  this one is different  this time you are not the one who makes a decision  she is  and now she is playing this  i got to think about everything    let us have a break  game  she is already made her decision  thereis nothing you can do and you know it  and deep down you know that her decision is the right one  you have to get rid of the trash one day  it is been piling up for 5 years  but it still makes you feel dreaded  amp  hurt  it is been 5 years after all  5 fucking years   it is been 2  years since all of this happened and now i think that this emotional mess was still better than my life now  i miss her  i miss having someone besides me  even if the love is  fake   even if something is happening behind your back  i miss hugging someone at the end of a stressful day  i miss feeling safe  even if this feeling is just an illusion  life has changed a lot during these 2 years   i made an incredible career  i have lost some friends but i still have a couple  tried dating and i was not too successful  i gained some weight  not obese in any way  just overweight   lost all of my confidence  now i am not as extroverted as i used to be  i am still assertive  amp  confident in my work environment  which contributed greatly in my career  but i am pretty shy in any other social environment  i started smoking and i really hate who i am now   and i am trying to change it  i started going to the gym  did not stick to the schedule at first  i relied on my gym buddy too much probably  did not want to go alone  started over after a break of 5 months  going alone now and i really started liking it  well apart from feeling lonely all the time  either way  covid 19 comes  townis in quarantine  gym is closed  always getting into some kind of obstacle  at least this obstacle is the real one   either way  during these 2  years  maybe even 3 years   i was feeling worse and worse each day  the life seems to go nowhere  i have nothing and no one and i honestly do not even believe that it is going to change  i am staying alone most of the time  i want to do something  i want to have friends  to be between people  i want to find new hobbies  new activities  be more positive  outgoing  confident  it seems to be so easy to everyone but not for me  i occasionally see people having first dates in a restaurants  couples going through the aisle of the supermarket while holding each otheris hands  i miss those things  i miss my old self  nobody likes my current self  even i do not  and i probably cannot even expect other people to like me   but one day  quite recently  i woke up in the morning feeling    different  for the first time in 2 3 years i had a positive outlook  i felt confident  it seemed like it is all going to be well for me  it was like jumping from one really cloudy  amp  sad universe to the one thatis sunny  needless to say  it did not last longer than a day  if it lasted longer  i would not be writing this terrible post here     i do not know what to do  i do not know how to change  i do not know how to find these bits of  old me  in my brain  i just do not know  and on top of that  i decided to check out my ex gf on social media  when we broke up  her new guy was not the best looking guy in the world and now he has posted pictures from the gym where he is fucking ripped  he progressed forward with his life and now i look at myself in a hypothetical mirror  and i am still depressed piece of shit  stuck in time since 2 years ago  will something change  or i will have to live miserably for god knows how many years  still being stuck in 2018 when my life took a 180 degree turn  or maybe i am making the progress  just that the progress is more depression  i do not know  it scares me to think that this is my life now  and it will be like this    forever   i have no idea what i am expecting from you guys by writing this post  i just hope that at least one or two people will read it  maybe someone will be able to recognize themselves in my story  i d like to know how your life turned out  sorry if there are grammatical mistakes here  i unfortunately do not have energy to proof read it right now  just wanted to get my thoughts out in the wild ',\n",

i have tried to keep this as short as i can but it is quite long    i would also normally do a second draft but i do not feel like reading this again so i hope it is ok   there are two major things in my life that lead me here  to start  i was neglected by my parents  they where never mean  they did not let me go hungry  they did not ignore me  in fact i am still living with them   they just never pushed me to do anything    ever  when i was 12 they pulled me out of school to move to another state and simply never put me back in school  my dad tried homeschooling me for a month or two but quickly gave up   because of this i grew up very shy of other people and never had much luck making friends  i spent my teens mostly in my room playing games  watching movies and not much else  i was very isolated  i cannot decide how much blame to level against myself for this  how much should a 15 year old be blamed for not enrolling himself in high school  especially when it does not seem to matter to anyone around him   similarly they never pushed me to get a job and so i just    never did i did go to film school  which is a whole  long  sad  depressing story in and of it is self  but nothing came of it  i also spent a few months looking for work but did not get so much as an email back from anyone  i guess it is not hard to see why when you  an employer  are looking at a 28 year old with no work experience     about the only good thing that came out of this was meeting my long time boyfriend which leads me to the second major thing  i met him on line when i was 17 and we have been together for about a decade now  long distance relationships are hard  but it is even harder to sustain one for so long  i love him more than anything and love being around him  every year one of us goes to visit the other for a few months and they have been some of the happiest times in my life  that being said there have been some extremely hard times  not the least of which was when he cheated on me   he is always bee very sexual so i suppose i should have known what i was getting myself into  we had a semi open relationship  it was not my idea and after years of arguing we came to a compromise  blowjobs only  it upset me but seemed almost necessary  we only see each other once a year  we where both young and horny  one of us hornier than the other  and it seemed like a fair compromise to let him explore with other people since he could not do it with me   he started becoming infatuated with one of his friends  he told me over and over again that it was nothing serious  i really believe he thought that because one day he came to me  told me that i was right and said he was backing off and told his friend to do this same  about a year later he cheated on me with him multiple times  he broke our rule which he knew i was already not a fan of   what you need to understand is  the last two paragraphs take place over years  when ever he would go out with his friends i was always left alone to wonder what he is doing with them  it was constant torture and thatis before he cheated on me  and he knew that  it did not help anything that he was surrounded by people to play around with but i was not  i only had him  i am 28 and have only ever been with four people including him  the other three where out of desperation  a way to back at keep up with him and the only way to  at least in some part  blow off some of that frustration and anger  because of that  it was always awkward and i only saw one of them more than once  i really started to grow to hate sex   when he cheated on me it destroyed me  it was the lowest moment in my life  no one to talk to  no real friends  no guidance  nothing  we spent months trying to patch things up  i still loved him and cared about him and did not want to be without him so    i decided to open the relationship entirely  my only rule was to use a condom  which he had not been   i feel like a door mat    he cheated on me and i rewarded him by not only letting him keep hanging out with the guy  who he says is his best friend  but also let him keep sleeping with him  whenever i was out of contact with him because he was out with his friends my depression and jealousy was crippling  i tore my room apart  was always angry  and was just generally out of control of my own brain   i even tried to see a shrink during this time who ignored the things i wanted to talk about  did not seem to care at all about this mess  kept fucking up my billing and forgetting to schedule appointments   the time of year came when we would see each other and it was decided i would go to him this time  he thought if i met the guy that i would not feel so bad  i spent three months there  it was incredibly awkward with his friends and especially that guy  the trip was very stressful  his so called  best friend  was a huge dick and constantly made a problem of himself to the point of even my boyfriend losing it on multiple occasions  after the whole mess my boyfriend said he really does not blame me for hating him   despite that  our relationship got back on track  we where doing really well  this was going to be the first year we spent christmas together  i went there in the summer  then a few months later he came here for christmas  in between  he put the open part of our relationship on hold which made me really happy   but now christmas is over and he is gone back home and we are not sure when we will see each other again  we are trying to get married but international marriage is difficult and we are currently at a loss  it is always hard when we separate after months together but this time has been much harder  we do not know when we will see each other again  both of us are very stressed out trying to bring our lives together while also trying to support ourselves individually and  for me  on top of it is the memory of the place i was in last year and i feel myself sliding back to the anger and jealousy  i know it is only a matter of time before he starts fooling around again and i know he is already trying to open the possibility with more of his friends   i do not know how to handle this anymore  i am tired of only having myself to talk to  i am tired of feeling walked on  i am tired of feeling like  even if i wanted to  i do not have the life or personality that would let me participate in this openness   i really do love him and i know he really loves me  when we are together we are inseparable and do everything together  but when we are apart it is like i become less important to his life    maybe it is just his defense mechanism for dealing with the distance but when we separate all i want to do is cling to him  he seems to pull away and it is a lot of work to keep things together   so  my situation is  i am 28  living with my parents  never had a job  have no life skills and very little social skills  i am in a long distance relationship with someone i love more than anything but he cheated on me and is now back home with his friends who  any one of them could be the next person  i have no friends and my parents  who neglected me  are really my only family  i am depressed  angry  scared and above all  i cannot even motivate myself to do the things i know i need to do  feel completely useless and broken   i was laying in bed last night with all of this running through my head  remembering of course that even all this is only a small part of the story  theiris definitely more   and the thought just occurred to me   what if i just fucking killed

if not mostly by the state specifically for people w  disabilities   but thatis beside the point        anyway     i have got a big problem and i do not know how to get over it   i should point out that i have probably posted here before in preparation for this move  it took 5 months between signing the lease and actually moving in and starting to live here   so bear with me if any of this sounds familiar     if that bothers you  just please ignore it and move on rather than bothering me with  trolling    sorry  i got a bit off topic there for a minute  my problem is that i basically just sit in my apartment all day watching t v  or playing games  i have met a handful of people either in the halls  or knocking on doors when i first moved in  just to introduce myself and  say hi    which took a lot of courage for me as i have got social anxiety and fear the heck out of getting out of my comfort zone   at any rate  so far i have met  or at least casually said  hi  and at times attempted to start a conversation with to a  handful  of people either in the dining hall they have set up for the lunch program i am signed up for or in the hallways  but i frankly cannot find pretty much anyone i want to or am capable of even really having a conversation with letting alone really getting to know them  there was one guy that i liked  but he was like in a bad mood that day or is just really introverted  and thatis coming from an  uber introvert  lol  or something like that   he did not even want to offer up his name   having said that  hereis my real problem  and likely the point where you all start to  hate  me lol smh    1  i am admittedly somewhat  bigoted  if you will against pwd   persons w  disabilities  for those unfamiliar with the acronym   a  self hating pwd   if you will  it is not that i find anything inherently  wrong  or  bad  with pwd  so much as it is i am so fucking god damned sick and tired of being labeled as nothing but a pwd  and having us always being pigeonholed into having to spend time with one another  because  normal   for lack of a better  more  p c   term  society does not want anything to do with us and  god forbid  they actually want to make friends with us or spend time with us   2  i will say  there are a number of people here that are either intellectually     significantly      below my level  or they have some sort of speech impediment  probably from some sort of issue with their brain that interferes with their brainis ability to produce speech or something like that sorry  i am not an expert on those disabilities nor speaking apparently as this is a major run on sentence    sorry    neither of which there is anything intrinsically wrong with whatsoever  but it does severely impact my ability to want to be friends with them or get to know them  i quite simply no longer have the patience anymore to try to get to know somebody who does not have the mental capacity to talk about anything more than her apparent obsession with  kitties   true story  there is actually someone here who all she talks about is cats  or to try to discern what someone is saying every time they open their mouths because unfortunately they are so impaired mentally that they struggle to form coherent speech  thatis like    well    over 50  of the people i have come across so far  and the ones who are not impaired in those ways that i have met so far  are either significantly older than me  this apartmentis average age i d say is well over 50  and i am not yet 34  or we just have nothing in common as i am obsessed with sports and movies and t v  and i have yet to meet a single person here who has the same interests   note  sorry i should have tried to found a way to break this up into more paragraphs  but could not figure out a good way to do so    now  mind you   i know damn well that my inherent biases and super anti social tendencies are playing a  big   part here  but i just cannot bring myself to find anybody here who i want to get to know or hang out with  for that matter  none of the people i    have    introduced myself to so far have bothered to call me or knock on my door or even say  hi  in passing me in the hallways   i have thought about trying to find a way to  get involved  in the community  outside  of the building  but between my  anti social  tendencies and fear running my life and scaring the shit out of me in that sense every way possible prohibiting me from doing it so far  the other problem i have with it  is there is basically only about a 3 hour window   maximum   that i want to fill during the   daytime   hours  roughly 12 ish to 4 45 ish  my shows start at 5 00      including transportation  which having to rely on  para transit   means i could spend most of that time waiting    and even that time i could probably spend catching up with shows i have missed that i want to see on demand  basically  as has been the case for as long as i can remember  i am a t v   and computer  addict   and i am largely okay with it  except i know it is unhealthy and antisocial  ideally  i d like to be more social  but between being addicted to my electronics and being scared to death of socializing and the prospect of socializing with a bunch of people in the building that quite frankly i do not seem to  want  to get to know  and they have certainly made no attempt to get to know me with the exception of one old lady who we do not have much in common  and she is already admitted that i am a  dick    which i already knew so i was not offended  the idea is less than appetizing   note  thankfully  she does not seem to mind that i am a dick  but again we only ate lunch together one time and i never got her apartment number and i have not seen her since    so to make a long story short   how do i get over my fears  and out of my funk  while still maintaining the things i enjoy  like surfing the net and binge ing on t v     i am thinking about volunteering  but the last time i tried  before i moved  i seem to remember those places always want you to volunteer   understandably  for a lot more hours than i am willing to commit to   i will end by saying  if anyone is even stil reading this  tl<smile>r  post at this point   that there is no need to point out any sort of  self sabotaging  or  excuse making  on my point  i am well aware i do all of that

male  i would describe myself as at times socially adept but then at times woefully inept  i have never had a romantic relationship before  i have only asked two women out in my life  one was just getting out of a divorce  and the other was married   i have read numerous times in places like  r askmen that it is important to work on myself before i subject others to myself  and all that stuff about being happy alone before being happy with someone else has helped drive me to work on being a better me  i have been content until very recently to just push aside thoughts of romantic relationships and work on becoming a better person   but then i wonder  how long  i do not have much time left  i feel  the older i get  i feel like the less likely i am to find someone who is still single and compatible   i finally made it into nursing school this past semester for my bsn  and i found someone in my clinical group whois so fucking smart  so hard working and so beautiful she is fucking appearing in my god damn dreams   they are just vanilla romantic dreams  where we just spend a day together   and then the alarm sounds and i am back to reality  and the dream begins to fade like smoke from a snuffed candle   of course  my first gut reaction to this is   you are infatuated with her  it is nothing but puppy love  she does not deserve this kind of affection and you would be doing a disservice to her and yourself if you decide to actively pursue this relationship    oh  did i also mention she is 20  seven years younger than me  and brimming with potential  i feel like i d only drag her down   fuck  she is so incredible  honoris college  ta  student tutoring on the side  and actively pursuing research for her planned ph d  her work ethic is utterly inspiring and being in her presence pushes me to work harder  we both like science fiction  we can speak on each otheris level when it comes to the medical sciences and i just really enjoy being around her   i enjoy her presence so much that i have been making an utter fool out of myself trying to get her to laugh  only to perhaps get a concerned glance from our instructors and an awkwardly quiet room   and thatis also the crazy part  i feel like i am actually good at being a nondescript student with a slight penchant for appropriate humor  and i have worked in healthcare for eight years  and i know how to be a professional  but around her i just fucking lose damn near all sense   but my insecurities are also still present  self concepts that i am working on dispelling  i am quite short  5 2   and she is at least a whole head taller than me  around 5 7  or so  my research into the dating scene also reveals asian men as one of the least desirable populations for women to date   of course  the other  better me says  if she cares that much about your height and ethnicity  she was never going to be a good match for you anyway   so then i think  okay  why not just ask her out and see what happens  then i think  whatis the worst that can happen   it could harm the group that we belong to and make it that much more awkward for the 2 3 of a semester that we have moving forwards  not to mention that we also have summer classes together as well   again  i think  well  if she is not mature enough to let me down easy and keep our business between us  then maybe she was not ever worth it in the first place   and then i start thinking   why even assume anything about her and her preferences and all that in the first place   just ask  i think   just ask  be simple  no expectations beyond just expressing a baseline interest  even if inside you are way the fuck past that   i brim with confidence for a brief few hours and i think  listen  we will just ask her to dinner and it does not have to be anything more than that  if she feels it  and we really feel it  then maybe we will go for it  but if not  thatis okay  and at least you tried   time passes and my doubt overshadows the fledgling confidence that i had just held   i do not know anything about relationships  i do not even know where to begin  where to go  what to do  i have some vague ideas of how a relationship is to be  that most of a relationship will be the mundane  and that not all of it is necessarily a whirlwind tempest of passion  but a slow grind together towards shared goals   or maybe i am just completely in the wrong and i actually really  truly  have not the slightest clue of what it means to be in a relationship and my thoughts are purely fantasies and rainbows in assholes   to further expand  i am scared that i am just not good enough  that i do not have the life skills or experience to keep and hold a relationship healthy and alive   i just    i just really wish i had the guts just to do it  at least then i would know  but the threat of rejection again  after all of this stupid emotional investment would just crush me   anyway  i know this is not quite on the caliber of some of the posts in here

blink a couple of times  the heavy weights at the corners of his mouth momentarily forgotten as his brow furrowed in thought  it is not often heart speaks so clearly  that in itself is something to note    you cannot do  what  any longer   mind asked in confusion  sure  they had not been on top of the world  but things could be so much worse  in fact  things were fine    i do not know  thatis what scares me   heart replied sadly  mind noticed his gaze was fixed on the knife in his hand  a very sharp  stainless steel knife he had used hundreds of times for cooking  it was actually his favorite kitchen knife  in this instance  he had picked it up to slice and apple for a snack   what do i have to do to make this stop   mind looked at the knife too and felt a faint stirring of alarm begin to flower    i do not know  how  to make it stop  i did not start it in the first place  i mean cannot you just ignore it   mind asked  he looked nervously at the knife  he had never known heart to do something like this  where was this coming from  heart turned the knife in his hand allowing the single light over the kitchen sink play across the blade  up  down the blade it went as heart stared at it  his right arm rotated ever so slightly  exposing the forearm for a moment    we have  been  ignoring it  you know that  you have been rationalizing them as  down  days  bad days  or days where i was just being moody  even when i tried to tell you it was more than that  we have even tried to search online to figure out how to fix whatever this is and how to make it stop  it is been going on for a long time now  nearly a decade  i am just so tired  so sad  so   heartis voice trailed off as he seemed to be searching for words    depressed   mind supplied  heart almost immediately started shaking his head     no  well yes   but no   heart responded  mind looked confused  but then upon further reflection  he slowly nodded his head     you are right  thatis not it  something caused this depression but what  why are not you happy  you have every right to be happy  you are married to an amazing woman who loves you  you have a great job  and friends  and   heartis frown deepened  but he kept his eyes on the blade    and what   he prompted  then shook his head angrily   the fruits of my labors have been what  if i die tomorrow  what will be missed  the provision i supply  the money i donate  and why are you shaking your head   heart demanded angrily   you know it is true   mind sighed  he is heard this one many times before    people love you   mind stated   you know that   heartis grip tightened on the knife  and a bitter expression suddenly filled his face    but i get all the broken ones   he hissed   i get them  and then i feel like i have to help them  and do whatever i can to help them heal  to mend those broken things  i have to teach them about what love is  or what a good friend is  how to trust again  how to smile again  but what about me    his voice is now an angry shout   i look back and every time i get the broken ones  yes  i love them  but what about romantic love  what about someone seeing to  my  needs   heart asked hotly   why do i always come last   why am i always treated as an afterthought   just  once  i want to not just love someone  but to be  in  love  just once i want for someone to to well fuck it  what does it matter   heartis head drops and his shoulders slump  he sighs sadly  and places the knife on the cutting board next to the apple mind had placed there moments before  mind was silent for a bit trying to absorb what heart was trying to say  and what he had said    i think i am starting to understand   mind said uncertainly   but what can we do  we have made our choices  you and i  we cannot go tearing it all apart just because we are not happy  it affects everyone else around us  i know you  and you would not want to hurt those people  tearing everything up in an effort to find whatever it is you are looking for would do just that   heart swallowed hard  and his eyes watered    but i cannot keep going on like this either   he said quietly   i cry so easily  and at the dumbest things  i get jealous for the dumbest reasons  and when i find a new friend  i cling too tightly and thatis just the tip of the iceberg  you know that  this is not how a normal person acts   mind nodded tiredly  he was exhausted  really  he was  always  exhausted    i know and it is starting to affect me  too  i have had much more difficulty focusing  and it keeps getting worse  i cannot ever rest until i am exhausted  believe me  i am as tired as you are  though for different reasons  i thought we would be doing something a lot different than we are right now  and   quite frankly   making a chunk more money than we are  granted  it has not been effecting me for nearly as long as it has you   mind confessed  mind and heart gazed at the apple  then picked up the knife and efficiently sliced it  a tear slid down heartis face  and as they finished slicing the apple  heart sniffed his nose  stifling a sob    see what i mean  this is stupid  i am crying  why   heart said    a sad smile touched mindis face as he replied   also ironic  it seems we are just as broken   heart scoffed  then looked at the knife  the blade glistened with apple juice    let us just take a sleeping pill and get a good nightis rest   heart suggested resignedly   maybe that will help   mind nodded  he desperately needed more than a few hours of sleep  it sounded as good of an idea as any  but then looked at the

mean t  last year   was my senior year in high school  i was at the top of my class and i had big plans to get into a prestigious college and finish off my high school career excelling  god  the universe or whatever all mighty being that controls us however  had other plans for me  my life seemed to fall apart piece by piece in front of me   this may seem crazy to some but it was the beginning of my devastation  my hs releases the top 10  of the graduating class every year  by gpa  and posted the order and the students  pictures in front of the auditorium  i am a quiet and shy person and i felt this was my chance to prove myself and it was something i strove hard for  when the results came out  i realized i had missed the cut  after speaking to my friends and comparing the gpais of the students on the list  i realized i missed it by 0 005 points   at the time  my sister  20  was at odds with me and my family over a myriad of issues including her arrogant asshole boyfriend who she refused to leave no matter how many times she was manipulated by him  i was extremely close to my sister throughout our childhood  but she  along with her boyfriend repeatedly disrespected and took advantage of my parents and i  facing all of this family conflict i sat there powerless  my words mean t nothing to my parents or my sister and despite the fact that my sister ended up getting kicked out of the house after an argument  my parents continued to pay for her  45k tuition  i loved my sister and when i contacted her truly offering my best advice  she would not hear anyof it  she threatened to cut me out of her life for good   i was distraught  and due to this and the accumulation of the depression over the years of stress  i finally broke  i ended up missing missing over a quarter of the school year  mostly consecutively  while i was enrolled in mostly ap level classes including physics c  e amp m in one year   calc bc  including ab content   and us gov pol  during my time away from school i began self harm  thoughts of suicide grew  we searched desperately for help  and i had to convince a doctor to not have me put in an adolescent psychiatric ward as i sat on his patient table  i have nothing against good psychiatric wards  i just knew it was not the right choice for me   eventually i found my match a pnp saved my life  medicated me correctly and i was on my way to recovery   however  now i was faced with the challenge of catching up on 3 intense ap classes while remaining stable  my teachers all advised me to drop my classes  but i refused  on my transition back i worked the hardest i had ever worked before  i was allowed 2 weeks of half days to help myself acclimate  and everyday those two weeks i came home and watched my teachers math videos from 12 pm to 7 pm on double speed  i followed all the class notes  and did all the homework  i was able to catch myself up completely  except for tests taken  to the rest of the class within those 2 weeks  i ended that year with 5s on all my aps except history   this was the biggest accomplishment of my life and i was extremely proud and while i missed a few college application during my time out of school i was accepted into an engineering program at a school ranked in the top  15 for engineering in the u s  that year     i wanted to share this to show you guys since many like myself think its the end when something like this happens  but you can persevere with the right help and determination      do not read more if u want a story to have a good ending <neutralface>  i wish i could tell you i stayed in a good state of mind after all that but sadly i have fallen in darker times than i have ever experienced  i rarely leave the house  and i wake

rough and i am starting to feel like the people i used to be able to count on are no longer there for me  i feel lost and the prospect of suicide seems more and more inviting as the days pass  i have other university prospects and am on a search for a part time job but my motivation falls everyday and my will to carry on has fallen to an all time low  i can no longer even describe how horrible i

and abusing the increasingly higher dose of drugs i am being given for my symptoms  i have blacked out from these drugs once so far and truly believe i could have died from the combination i took  obv this was not the recommended usage of the drugs    i feel like i am at the end of the road and if things dont get better soon i may have to find my own way out     i would not wish this upon anyone

couple of days earlier in the week  and ultimately ignored my family  work  and my therapist  then i went back into work on saturday and nothing felt right  i could not really remember what i did over the two days  and checking my internet history thereis 15 hours of blank  between 2pm and 5am  i d only woken up at 11am that morning so i could not have fallen back asleep after just 3 hours  right  so what happened in that 15 hours    i am no stranger to drugs and used to be addicted to various pills  but i stopped that  except i found some in my room in a baggie  i am sure they must have been from a long time ago because as far as i know i have not relapsed  but the tablets i found are consistent with blackouts  what if i found them  took them  and forgot  am i even clean anymore  what if i am so far gone that i actually went out and got them and forgot  then i really would be going insane  i threw the rest down the toilet and in the week since  i have no found anymore or missed any time  which is a relief  but anyway  on that saturday i started convincing myself something was wrong  i d missed a shift without calling in because i had fallen asleep for 21 hours  or so i hope i was asleep   and i d been late earlier that week too    first i thought i was going to get fired  i had texted my boss after two days to say i am sorry i did not respond  but that i was embarrassed for missing my shift and would explain later  when i came in  it is like he did not know what to do with me  and put me on an easy department  i d discussed with my friend and colleague on watsapp how my body was not used to the heavy lifting  i d been on holiday for two weeks  and after my first week back i was really struggling to do the things i d gotten used to  i work shelf stocking at a grocery store   and i d told him i was used to certain areas  suddenly my boss put me on those areas and the usual guy who did them  put him elsewhere  so i convinced myself he had read my messages with my friend  he was looking at ways to fire me  the colleague on the aisle near me kept coming round to do bits on my aisle  and i was completely convinced he was watching me  to this day i still think he was  in fact that whole day was off  and ever since my colleagues have not been treating me the same  like they have all been let in on something that i do not know  am i being investigated  did my counsellor worry so much that she got in touch   i kept overhearing whispers and people looking at me  walking home that night i spotted several people driving past  people i never see  three people offered me lifts  i even took a half hour detour scared out my mind there would be people at my house ready to section me or something  i was having a full blown paranoid episode  and i swear i have never felt that way in my entire life  i have felt disconnected  almost like i am not real sometimes  but never like that  i finally made my way home and my flatmate was there  by the door  then i convinced myself she was in on it  whatever  it  was  and i kept hearing the door going every 10 seconds and people talking or whispering  my two flatmates were downstairs watching tv together and they literally never do that  i kept locking my door every time i went to the bathroom because i thought maybe they were going to search my room   for what  i have no clue   i still do this  even though it is been days    the next day was no better  the girl he normally puts on the aisle i was put on  was told she was going to take me off at 3am  i overheard this conversation with a colleague  but when i asked her if she was on there at all  she said no  this girl was then in the staffroom when my boss told me to go up and get my till code because i d be on tills for a bit  so  naturally  i convinced myself she was up there spying to see what locker i had my bag in  i do not know where that idea had come from  but the night before  i had felt so confined by the fact that i was never left alone  even on my breaks where i d received texts like  where did you go   when i went to the toilet  i  escaped  when my colleague left my aisle  and ran upstairs to the toilet  as i came back down  i bumped into my boss  who had been nowhere to be found for an hour before that  and by bumped i mean literally bumped  as in he was running  he stumbled backwards onto the stairs  i laughed  and it is even funnier thinking about it now  but it was so foreign to me  why did he happen to be running up the stairs like a minute after i d gone up  am i just making this all up in my head    i came out of my room yesterday properly for the first time in a couple of days and walked past my flatmate  i decided to actually speak to her because this whole paranoid running in and out thing  as well as not eating anything  was not helping  if i was going to get hospitalised i was not helping the issue by hiding out and locking my door and having the worlds quickest shower in case someone was trying to break in  so we spoke  and then we really spoke  for hours we chatted  and i felt so much better  i d also gone for a long walk to my local park  and although i was convinced i d seen the same car driving around and that the man with the dog was watching me  i had dismissed it by the end of the day  and am feeling a lot more able to do things today  i ate dinner yesterday  after realising i have lost almost a stone in the past month  13lbs   then i have eaten today and had two decent sleeps in a row  no random pills  no missing time  and i have rearrange my therapy appointment and got my doctor to write a note for my missed shift last week   it is terrifying to me to have these kind of paranoid thoughts  i have always been kind of a conspiracy sort of person  but never the sort of conspiracy that might involve myself  i see the world as a cold dark place sometimes but i have always surrounded myself with the warmth of my friends and family  so to be seeing as my friends and family and co workers plotting against me  or convincing myself i am hearing things etc  has been a new and scary place  i do not ever want to be that far gone ever again  the worst thing is i am still not completely convinced i was imagining everything  thereis 100  something up at work  maybe it is just that they have noticed my erratic behaviour and that in turn is causing more  i have texted my boss on two occasions now asking for a sit down to chat about anything he might want to talk about  and in response he has not replied  and has been avoiding me  yet everybody else seems to be constantly around  god what a hellish experience    could this be because of a depressive episode  or worse  maybe there really is something wrong  i will let you know if i get sacked or something  then my delusions may have not been delusions after all haha ',\n",

for nearly a year   we live in canada  and there are some that think canada is a place full of great social programs and thereis no way that any family can fall through any cracks  but it is not  and we have  do not get me wrong  there is some funding we get  but due to my job  and our unique  bear with me  i will explain  circumstances  we are living from paycheck to paycheck  with no hope of getting out of our mental health  financial  and housing challenges  nor being able to afford helping our children have a bright future  this is not even considering fairly severe climate anxiety from my wife and i   my dear wife suffered much childhood trauma  so much so that she is been diagnosed with c ptsd  the diagnosing psychologist told us that because it is not in the latest dsm  it is not officially recognized  and thus we cannot secure support for it  and just a few months ago she was diagnosed with fibroyalgia  just yesterday  her gynecologist told her thereis a growth of tissue next to her c section scar  it is been causing her immense pain on top of the usual fibro pain  she is got some therapy  but her sleep and gastrointestinal system cause daily problems  she is strong  and she is organized  but the load for her is physically  mentally  administratively immense   our oldest child was diagnosed with a very rare brain disorder at 6 months that manifests as severe cognitive mental physical disabilities  they are deaf  use a wheelchair for mobility  and use diapers  we are cognizant that children with severe special needs do not have typical life spans  as a result we are making plans for both their passing  and care for them should we pass  or are physically unable to give them care  they go to a decent school with excellent student teacher ratios  and their laugh is food for the soul  but diapers for a 9 y o   wheelchair van upkeep  leg braces  and medical cbd for their anxiety makes for a tight budget  they are on their second wheelchair  and we just finished paying off their first wheelchair last year  it was not covered by my jobis health insurance  and we were left with over  5k to pay out of pocket  if it was not for the portion covered by the province  we would still be paying it off   our middle child was diagnosed at 5 with moderate to severe autism  and developmental delay  thereis a decent chance they will also need our care for their entire life  like our oldest  we must plan for their care should we pass  or are unable to provide their care  their therapy that worked in the past is absolutely not in budget  there is no publicly available therapy for any children with autism in our province  school is not on the radar because there is not enough support  they were enrolled for their first year  but literally escaped the school too many times  many meetings  letters and such were had but no improvements were on the menu  we homeschool when my wife is physically able   our youngest child had an accident when they were an infant that led to hospital visits of varying lengths  specialists  and the involvement of both police and childrenis aid  they were just recently diagnosed with severe generalized anxiety to the point where the paediatrician was ready to prescribe prozac immediately  we have decided to go the medical cbd route for their mental illness as well as therapy offered free through my place of work  because of the anxietyis severity  we homeschool our youngest when my wife is physically able   my mother was diagnosed  treated  falsely cleared  re diagnosed  and re treated for non hodgkinis lymphoma  she is been in remission for a few months and her hair is growing back  but my parents live over 2400km away and travel is not in the budget   after my mother was diagnosed  i cried every day  sometimes several times a day  i felt like my entire life was imploding and dreamt of just dying  i did not make any suicide plans  but it was on my mind very often  i knew deep down that it would only benefit me and no one else  i tried to stay exercising  but have not seen the gym in months now  my doc put me on a fairly heavy dose of effexor  and now my blood pressure is creeping up  i still feel like my life is imploding  but at least i am not actively looking for ways to off myself  my wife and i kind of joke with each other about how we are lightning rods for the whole province   our home is not ideal  our oldest child is one floor below us  and we are in constant fear of not hearing them through the monitor we have if they need us in the night  the noise is incessant from many types of aircraft and traffic  the wind howls nearly every day because of our proximity to an airfield  our shed makes ramshackle look ritzy and we are literally waiting for it to fall down  my wife cannot find a job because our provinceis school system is failing two of our children  as parents  we are on constant and never ending meltdown prevention for our children  we only kind of joke with each other about wondering what will happen next  we cannot afford upkeep on our wheelchair van  we cannot afford the therapies that would help our children the most  the money we are able to save is towards our childrenis rdspis and respis  there is also some money saved to buy an accessible home but we cannot afford to find a home that is not next to an airport  let alone one that is accessible for my oldest child  or my wifeis fibro   our mental health is in tatters  we do not have anyone who can provide respite overnight  i have resorted to googling if thereis any wealthy people who can be a sponsor for our family that seems plagued by calamity and setback  beats committing suicide  i suppose  my wife and i are both sleeping terribly  we are both in need of peace and quiet for a few days  we are both trying desperately to have enough mental energy to ensure that our kids do not grow up neglected  or grow up with worse mental health than us  but we cannot go on  we are
